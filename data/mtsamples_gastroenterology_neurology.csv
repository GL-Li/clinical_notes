1,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal wall abscess.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal wall abscess.PROCEDURE: Incision and drainage (I&D) of abdominal abscess, excisional debridement of nonviable and viable skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle, then removal of foreign body.ANESTHESIA: LMA.INDICATIONS: Patient is a pleasant 60-year-old gentleman, who initially had a sigmoid colectomy for diverticular abscess, subsequently had a dehiscence with evisceration. Came in approximately 36 hours ago with pain across his lower abdomen. CT scan demonstrated presence of an abscess beneath the incision. I recommended to the patient he undergo the above-named procedure. Procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, alternatives forms of therapy were discussed with him, and he was agreeable to surgery.FINDINGS: The patient was found to have an abscess that went down to the level of the fascia. The anterior layer of the fascia was fibrinous and some portions necrotic. This was excisionally debrided using the Bovie cautery, and there were multiple pieces of suture within the wound and these were removed as well.TECHNIQUE: Patient was identified, then taken into the operating room, where after induction of appropriate anesthesia, his abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in a sterile fashion. The wound opening where it was draining was explored using a curette. The extent of the wound marked with a marking pen and using the Bovie cautery, the abscess was opened and drained. I then noted that there was a significant amount of undermining. These margins were marked with a marking pen, excised with Bovie cautery; the curette was used to remove the necrotic fascia. The wound was irrigated; cultures sent prior to irrigation and after achievement of excellent hemostasis, the wound was packed with antibiotic-soaked gauze. A dressing was applied. The finished wound size was 9.0 x 5.3 x 5.2 cm in size. Patient tolerated the procedure well. Dressing was applied, and he was taken to recovery room in stable condition."
2,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Congenital chylous ascites and chylothorax.2. Rule out infradiaphragmatic lymphatic leak.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Diffuse intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia.ANESTHESIA: General.INDICATION: The patient is an unfortunate 6-month-old baby boy, who has been hospitalized most of his life with recurrent chylothoraces and chylous ascites. The patient has been treated somewhat successfully with TPN and voluntary restriction of enteral nutrition, but he had repeated chylothoraces. Last week, Dr. X took the patient to the operating room in hopes that with thoracotomy, a thoracic duct leak could be found, which would be successfully closed surgically. However at the time of his thoracotomy exploration what was discovered was a large amount of transdiaphragmatic transition of chylous ascites coming from the abdomen. Dr. X opened the diaphragm and could literally see a fountain of chylous fluid exiting through the diaphragmatic hole. This was closed, and we decided that perhaps an abdominal exploration as a last stage effort would allow us to find an area of lymphatic leak that could potentially help the patient from this dismal prognostic disease. We met with his parents and talked to them about this, and he is here today for that attempt.OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient's abdomen was relatively soft, minimally distended. Exploration through supraumbilical transverse incision immediately revealed a large amount of chylous ascites upon entering into the peritoneal cavity. What we found which explains the chronic chylous ascites and chylothorax was a diffuse lymphangiectatic picture involving the small bowel mesentery approximately two thirds to three quarters of the distal small bowel including all of the ileum, the cecum, and the portion of the ascending colon. It appeared that any attempt to resect this area would have been met with failure because of the extensive lymphatic dilatation all the way down towards the root of the supramesenteric artery. There was about one quarter to one third of the jejunum that did not appear to be grossly involved, but I did not think that resection of three quarters of the patient's small bowel would be viable surgical option. Instead, we opted to close his abdomen and refer for potential small intestine transplantation procedure in the future if he is a candidate for that.The lymphatic abnormality was extensive. They were linear dilated lymphatic channels on the serosal surface of the bowel in the mesentery. They were small aneurysm-like pockets of chyle all along the course of the mesenteric structures and in the mesentery medially adjacent to the bowel as well. No other major retroperitoneal structure or correctable structure was identified. Both indirect inguinal hernias were wide open and could be palpated from an internal aspect as well.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was brought from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit to the operating room within an endotracheal tube im place and with enteral feeds established at full flow to provide maximum fat content and maximum lymphatic flow. We conducted a surgical time-out and reiterated all of the patient's important identifying information and confirmed the operative plan as described above. Preparation and draping of his abdomen was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then we opened his peritoneal cavity through a transverse supraumbilical incision dividing both rectus muscles and all layers of the abdominal wall fascia. As the peritoneal cavity was entered, we divided the umbilical vein ligamentum teres remnant between Vicryl ties, and we were able to readily identify a large amount of chylous ascites that had been previously described. The bowel was eviscerated, and then with careful inspection, we were able to identify this extensive area of intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia that was a source of the patient's chylous ascites. The small bowel from the ligament of Treitz to the proximal to mid jejunum was largely unaffected, but did not appear that resection of 75% of the small intestine and colon would be a satisfactory tradeoff for The patient, but would likely render him with significant short bowel and nutritional and metabolic problems. Furthermore, it might burn bridges necessary for consideration of intestinal transplantation in the future if that becomes an option. We suctioned free all of the chylous accumulations, replaced the intestines to their peritoneal cavity, and then closed the patient's abdominal incision with 4-0 PDS on the posterior sheath and 3-0 PDS on the anterior rectus sheath. Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for skin closure.The patient tolerated the procedure well. He lost minimal blood, but did lose approximately 100 mL of chylous fluid from the abdomen that was suctioned free as part of the chylous ascitic leak. The patient was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with his endotracheal tube in place and to consider the next stage of management, which might be an attempted additional type of feeding or referral to an Intestinal Transplantation Center to see if that is an option for the patient because he has no universally satisfactory medical or surgical treatment for this at this time."
3,Gastroenterology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Abdominal pain.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 71-year-old female patient of Dr. X. The patient presented to the emergency room last evening with approximately 7- to 8-day history of abdominal pain which has been persistent. She was seen 3 to 4 days ago at ABC ER and underwent evaluation and discharged and had a CT scan at that time and she was told it was ""normal."" She was given oral antibiotics of Cipro and Flagyl. She has had no nausea and vomiting, but has had persistent associated anorexia. She is passing flatus, but had some obstipation symptoms with the last bowel movement two days ago. She denies any bright red blood per rectum and no history of recent melena. Her last colonoscopy was approximately 5 years ago with Dr. Y. She has had no definite fevers or chills and no history of jaundice. The patient denies any significant recent weight loss.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for history of atrial fibrillation, under good control and now in normal sinus rhythm and on metoprolol and also on Premarin hormone replacement.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and hysterectomy. She has a long history of known grade 4 bladder prolapse and she has been seen in the past by Dr. Chip Winkel, I believe that he has not been re-consulted.ALLERGIES: SHE IS ALLERGIC OR SENSITIVE TO MACRODANTIN.SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not drink or smoke.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise negative for any recent febrile illnesses, chest pains or shortness of breath.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: The patient is an elderly thin white female, very pleasant, in no acute distress.VITAL SIGNS: Her temperature is 98.8 and vital signs are all stable, within normal limits.HEENT: Head is grossly atraumatic and normocephalic. Sclerae are anicteric. The conjunctivae are non-injected.NECK: Supple.CHEST: Clear.HEART: Regular rate and rhythm.ABDOMEN: Generally nondistended and soft. She is focally tender in the left lower quadrant to deep palpation with a palpable fullness or mass and focally tender, but no rebound tenderness. There is no CVA or flank tenderness, although some very minimal left flank tenderness.PELVIC: Currently deferred, but has history of grade 4 urinary bladder prolapse.EXTREMITIES: Grossly and neurovascularly intact.LABORATORY VALUES: White blood cell count is 5.3, hemoglobin 12.8, and platelet count normal. Alkaline phosphatase elevated at 184. Liver function tests otherwise normal. Electrolytes normal. Glucose 134, BUN 4, and creatinine 0.7.DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.IMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 71-year-old female with greater than one-week history of abdominal pain now more localized to the left lower quadrant. Currently is a nonacute abdomen. The working diagnosis would be sigmoid diverticulitis. She does have a history in the distant past of sigmoid diverticulitis. I would recommend a repeat stat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and keep the patient nothing by mouth. The patient was seen 5 years ago by Dr. Y in Colorectal Surgery. We will consult her also for evaluation. The patient will need repeat colonoscopy in the near future and be kept nothing by mouth now empirically. The case was discussed with the patient's primary care physician, Dr. X. Again, currently there is no indication for acute surgical intervention on today's date, although the patient will need close observation and further diagnostic workup."
4,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent re-infected sebaceous cyst of abdomen.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Abscess secondary to retained foreign body.2. Incisional hernia.PROCEDURES1. Excision of abscess, removal of foreign body.2. Repair of incisional hernia.ANESTHESIA: LMA.INDICATIONS: Patient is a pleasant 37-year-old gentleman who has had multiple procedures including a laparotomy related to trauma. The patient has had a recurrently infected cyst of his mass at the superior aspect of his incision, which he says gets larger and then it drains internally, causing him to be quite ill. He presented to my office and I recommended that he undergo exploration of this area and removal. The procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, and alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable to surgery.FINDINGS: The patient was found upon excision of the cyst that it contained a large Prolene suture, which is multiply knotted as it always is; beneath this was a very small incisional hernia, the hernia cavity, which contained omentum; the hernia was easily repaired.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was identified, then taken into the operating room, where after induction of an LMA anesthetic, his abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in sterile fashion. The puncta of the wound lesion was infiltrated with methylene blue and peroxide. The lesion was excised and the existing scar was excised using an ellipse and using a tenotomy scissors, the cyst was excised down to its base. In doing so, we identified a large Prolene suture within the wound and followed this cyst down to its base at which time we found that it contained omentum and was in fact overlying a small incisional hernia. The cyst was removed in its entirety, divided from the omentum using a Metzenbaum and tying with 2-0 silk ties. The hernia repair was undertaken with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture with simple sutures. The wound was then irrigated and closed with 3-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular and Steri-Strips. Patient tolerated the procedure well. Dressings were applied and he was taken to recovery room in stable condition."

He has lost about 200 pounds and was otherwise doing well until yesterday evening around 7:00-8:00 when he developed nausea and right upper quadrant pain, which apparently wrapped around toward his right side and back. He feels like he was on it but has not done so. He has overall malaise and a low-grade temperature of 100.3. He denies any prior similar or lesser symptoms. His last normal bowel movement was yesterday. He denies any outright chills or blood per rectum.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension and morbid obesity, now resolved.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Gastric bypass surgery in December 2007.MEDICATIONS: Multivitamins and calcium.ALLERGIES: None known.FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for diabetes mellitus in his father, who is now deceased.SOCIAL HISTORY: He denies tobacco or alcohol.

We will get an ultrasound this morning. He will need his gallbladder out, probably with intraoperative cholangiogram. Hopefully, the stone will pass this way. Due to his anatomy, an ERCP would prove quite difficult if not impossible unless laparoscopic assisted. Dr. X will see him later this morning and discuss the plan further. The patient understands."
6,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES1. Adrenal mass, right sided.2. Umbilical hernia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES1. Adrenal mass, right sided.2. Umbilical hernia.OPERATION PERFORMED: Laparoscopic hand-assisted left adrenalectomy and umbilical hernia repair.ANESTHESIA: General.CLINICAL NOTE: This is a 52-year-old inmate with a 5.5 cm diameter nonfunctioning mass in his right adrenal. Procedure was explained including risks of infection, bleeding, possibility of transfusion, possibility of further treatments being required. Alternative of fully laparoscopic are open surgery or watching the lesion.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: In the right flank-up position, table was flexed. He had a Foley catheter in place. Incision was made from just above the umbilicus, about 5.5 cm in diameter. The umbilical hernia was taken down. An 11 mm trocar was placed in the midline, superior to the GelPort and a 5 mm trocar placed in the midaxillary line below the costal margin. A liver retractor was placed to this.The colon was reflected medially by incising the white line of Toldt. The liver attachments to the adrenal kidney were divided and the liver was reflected superiorly. The vena cava was identified. The main renal vein was identified. Coming superior to the main renal vein, staying right on the vena cava, all small vessels were clipped and then divided. Coming along the superior pole of the kidney, the tumor was dissected free from top of the kidney with clips and Bovie. The harmonic scalpel was utilized superiorly and laterally. Posterior attachments were divided between clips and once the whole adrenal was mobilized, the adrenal vein and one large adrenal artery were noted, doubly clipped, and divided. Specimen was placed in a collection bag, removed intact.Hemostasis was excellent.The umbilical hernia had been completely taken down. The edges were freshened up. Vicryl #1 was utilized to close the incision and 2-0 Vicryl was used to close the fascia of the trocar.Skin closed with clips.He tolerated the procedure well. All sponge and instrument counts were correct. Estimated blood loss less than 100 mL.The patient was awakened, extubated, and returned to recovery room in satisfactory condition."
7,Gastroenterology,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Possible free air under the diaphragm.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 77-year-old female who is unable to give any information. She has been sedated with Ativan and came into the emergency room obtunded and unable to give any history. On a chest x-ray for what appeared to be shortness of breath she was found to have what was thought to be free air under the right diaphragm.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for alcohol abuse. Unable to really gather any other information because she is so obtunded.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Looking at the medical chart, she had an appendectomy, right hip fracture from a fall in 2005, and TAH/BSO.MEDICATIONS: Unable to evaluate.ALLERGIES: UNABLE TO EVALUATE.SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant history of alcohol abuse, according to the emergency room physician, who sees her on a regular basis.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unable to obtain.PHYSICAL EXAMVITAL SIGNS: Temp 98.3, heart rate 82, respiratory rate 24, and blood pressure 141/70.GENERAL: She is a very obtunded female who upon arousal is not able to provide any information of any use.HEENT: Atraumatic.NECK: Soft and supple.LUNGS: Bilaterally diminished.HEART: Regular.ABDOMEN: Soft, and with deep palpation I am unable to arouse the patient, unable to elicit any tenderness.LABORATORY STUDIES: Show a normal white blood cell count with no shift. Elevated AST at 138, with a normal ALT at 38. Alkaline phosphatase of 96, bilirubin 0.8. Sodium is 107, with 68 chloride and potassium of 2.8.X-ray of the chest shows the possibility of free air; therefore, a CT scan was obtained because of the patient's physical examination, which shows no evidence of intra-abdominal pathology. The etiology of the air under the diaphragm is actually a colonic air that is anterior superior to the dome of the diaphragm, near the dome of the liver.ASSESSMENT: No intra-abdominal pathology.PLAN: Have her admitted to the medical service for treatment of her hyponatremia."
8,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Appendicitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Appendicitis, nonperforated.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Appendectomy.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.A transverse right lower quadrant incision was made directly over the point of maximal tenderness. Sharp dissection utilizing Bovie electrocautery was used to expose the external oblique fascia. The fascia of the external oblique was incised in the direction of the fibers, and the muscle was spread with a clamp. The internal oblique fascia was similarly incised and its muscular fibers were similarly spread. The transversus abdominis muscle, transversalis fascia and peritoneum were incised sharply gaining entrance into the abdominal cavity without incident. Upon entering the peritoneal cavity, the peritoneal fluid was noted to be clean.The cecum was then grasped along the taenia with a moist gauze sponge and was gently mobilized into the wound. After the appendix was fully visualized, the mesentery was divided between Kelly clamps and ligated with 2-0 Vicryl ties. The base of the appendix was crushed with a clamp and then the clamp was reapplied proximally on the appendix. The base was ligated with 2-0 Vicryl tie over the crushed area, and the appendix amputated along the clamp. The stump of the appendix was cauterized and the cecum was returned to the abdomen.The peritoneum was irrigated with warm sterile saline. The mesoappendix and cecum were examined for hemostasis which was present. The wound was closed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl for the peritoneum and 0 Vicryl for the internal oblique and external oblique layers. The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. A dressing was placed on the wound. All surgical counts were reported as correct.Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
9,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis, gangrenous.PROCEDURE: Appendectomy.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room under urgent conditions. After having obtained an informed consent, he was placed in the operating room and under anesthesia. Followed by a time-out process, his abdominal wall was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Antibiotics had been given prior to incision. A McBurney incision was performed and it carried out through the peritoneal cavity. Immediately there was purulent material seen in the area. Samples were taken for culture and sensitivity of aerobic and anaerobic sets. The appendix was markedly swollen particularly in its distal three-fourth, where the distal appendix showed an abscess formation and devitalization of the wall. There was quite a bit of local peritonitis. The mesoappendix was clamped, divided and ligated, and then the appendix was ligated and divided, and the stump buried with a pursestring suture of Vicryl and then a Z stitch. The area was abundantly irrigated with normal saline and also the pelvis. The distal foot of small bowel had been explored and because it delivered itself __________ the incision and showed no pathology.Then the peritoneal and internal fascia were approximated with a suture of 0 Vicryl and then the incision was closed in layers and after each layer the wound was irrigated with normal saline. The skin was closed with a combination of a subcuticular suture of fine Monocryl followed by the application of Dermabond. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Estimated blood loss was minimal, and the patient was sent to the recovery room for recovery in satisfactory condition."
10,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Pelvic inflammatory disease.2. Periappendicitis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:1. Laparoscopic appendectomy.2. Peritoneal toilet and photos.ANESTHESIA: General.COMPLICATIONS: None.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 cc.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 31-year-old African-American female who presented with right lower quadrant abdominal pain presented with acute appendicitis. She also had mild leukocytosis with bright blood cell count of 12,000. The necessity for diagnostic laparoscopy was explained and possible appendectomy. The patient is agreeable to proceed and signed preoperatively informed consent.PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia by Anesthesia Department.The preoperative Foley, antibiotics, and NG tube are placed for decompression and the anterior abdominal wall was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and infraumbilical incision is performed with a #10 blade scalpel with anterior and superior traction on the abdominal wall. A Veress needle was introduced and 15 mm pneumoperitoneum is created with CO2 insufflation. At this point, the Veress needle was removed and a 10 mm trocar is introduced intraperitoneally. A second 5 mm port was introduced in the right upper quadrant under direct visualization and blunted graspers were introduced to bring the appendix into view. With the aid of a laparoscope, the pelvis was visualized. The ovaries are brought in views and photos are taken. There is evidence of a purulence in the cul-de-sac and ________ with a right ovarian hemorrhagic cyst. Attention was then turned on the right lower quadrant. The retrocecal appendix is freed with peritoneal adhesions removed with Endoshears. Attention was turned to the suprapubic area. The 12 mm port was introduced under direct visualization and the mesoappendix was identified. A 45 mm endovascular stapling device was fired across the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix sequentially with no evidence of bleeding or leakage from the staple line. Next, ________ tube was used to obtain Gram stain and cultures of the pelvic fluid and a pelvic toilet was performed with copious irrigation of sterile saline. Next, attention was turned to the right upper quadrant. There is evidence of adhesions from the liver surface to the anterior abdominal wall consistent with Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome also a prior pelvic inflammatory disease. All free fluid is aspirated and patient's all port sites are removed under direct visualization and the appendix is submitted to pathology for final pathology. Once the ports are removed the pneumoperitoneum is allowed to escape for patient's postoperative comfort and two larger port sites at the suprapubic and infraumbilical sites are closed with #0 Vicryl suture on a UR-6 needle. Local anesthetic is infiltrated at L3 port sites for postoperative analgesia and #4-0 Vicryl subcuticular closure is performed with undyed Vicryl. Steri-Strips are applied along with sterile dressings. The patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and transferred to recovery room with postoperative broad-spectrum IV antibiotics in the General Medical Floor. Routine postoperative care will be continued on this patient."
11,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis.PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic appendectomy.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.INDICATIONS: Patient is a pleasant 31-year-old gentleman who presented to the hospital with acute onset of right lower quadrant pain. History as well as signs and symptoms are consistent with acute appendicitis as was his CAT scan. I evaluated the patient in the emergency room and recommended that he undergo the above-named procedure. The procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable with surgery.FINDINGS: Patient was found to have acute appendicitis with an inflamed appendix, which was edematous, but essentially no suppuration.TECHNIQUE: The patient was identified and then taken into the operating room, where after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in sterile fashion. An infraumbilical incision was made and carried down by blunt dissection to the level of the fascia, which was grasped with an Allis clamp and two stay sutures of 2-0 Vicryl were placed on either side of the midline. The fascia was tented and incised and the peritoneum entered by blunt finger dissection. A Hasson cannula was placed and a pneumoperitoneum to 15 mmHg pressure was obtained. Patient was placed in the Trendelenburg position, rotated to his left, whereupon under direct vision, the 12-mm midline as well as 5-mm midclavicular and anterior axillary ports were placed. The appendix was easily visualized, grasped with a Babcock's. A window was created in the mesoappendix between the appendix and the cecum and the Endo GIA was introduced and the appendix was amputated from the base of the cecum. The mesoappendix was divided using the Endo GIA with vascular staples. The appendix was placed within an Endo bag and delivered from the abdominal cavity. The intra-abdominal cavity was irrigated. Hemostasis was assured within the mesentery and at the base of the cecum. All ports were removed under direct vision and then wounds were irrigated with saline antibiotic solution. The infraumbilical defect was closed with a figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl suture. The remaining wounds were irrigated and then everything was closed subcuticular with 4-0 Vicryl suture and Steri-Strips. Patient tolerated the procedure well, dressings were applied, and he was taken to recovery room in stable condition."
12,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute suppurative appendicitis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic appendectomy.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal and Marcaine 0.25% local.INDICATIONS: This 29-year-old female presents to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Department on 08/30/2003 with history of acute abdominal pain. On evaluation, it was noted that the patient has clinical findings consistent with acute appendicitis. However, the patient with additional history of loose stools for several days prior to event. Therefore, a CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained revealing findings consistent with acute appendicitis. There was no evidence of colitis on the CAT scan. With this in mind and the patient's continued pain at present, the patient was explained the risks and benefits of appendectomy. She agreed to procedure and informed consent was obtained.GROSS FINDINGS: The appendix was removed without difficulty with laparoscopic approach. The appendix itself noted to have a significant inflammation about it. There was no evidence of perforation of the appendix.PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient was placed in supine position. After appropriate anesthesia was obtained and sterile prep and drape completed, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make a curvilinear infraumbilical incision. Through this incision, a Veress needle was utilized to create a CO2 pneumoperitoneum of 15 mmHg. The Veress needle was then removed. A 10 mm trocar was then introduced through this incision into the abdomen. A video laparoscope was then inserted and the above noted gross findings were appreciated upon evaluation. Initially, bilateral ovarian cysts were appreciated, however, there was no evidence of acute disease on evaluation. Photodocumentation was obtained.A 5 mm port was then placed in the right upper quadrant. This was done under direct visualization and a blunt grasper was utilized to mobilize the appendix. Next, a 12 mm port was placed in the left lower quadrant lateral to the rectus musculature under direct visualization. Through this port, the dissector was utilized to create a small window in the mesoappendix. Next, an EndoGIA with GI staples was utilized to fire across the base of the appendix, which was done noting it to be at the base of the appendix. Next, staples were changed to vascular staples and the mesoappendix was then cut and vessels were then ligated with vascular staples. Two 6 X-loupe wires with EndoGIA were utilized in this prior portion of the procedure. Next, an EndoCatch was placed through the 12 mm port and the appendix was placed within it. The appendix was then removed from the 12 mm port site and taken off the surgical site. The 12 mm port was then placed back into the abdomen and CO2 pneumoperitoneum was recreated. The base of the appendix was reevaluated and noted to be hemostatic. Aspiration of warm saline irrigant then done and noted to be clear. There was a small adhesion appreciated in the region of the surgical site. This was taken down with blunt dissection without difficulty. There was no evidence of other areas of disease. Upon re-exploration with a video laparoscope in the abdomen and after this noting the appendix base to be hemostatic and intact. The instruments were removed from the patient and the port sites were then taken off under direct visualization. The CO2 pneumoperitoneum was released into the air and the fascia was approximated in the 10 mm and 12 mm port sites with #0 Vicryl ligature x2. Marcaine 0.25% was then utilized in all three incision sites and #4-0 Vicryl suture was used to approximate the skin and all three incision sites. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and taken to Postoperative Care Unit in stable condition and monitored under General Medical Floor on IV antibiotics, pain medications, and return to diet."
13,Gastroenterology,"EXAM: Barium enema.CLINICAL HISTORY: A 4-year-old male with a history of encopresis and constipation.TECHNIQUE: A single frontal scout radiograph of the abdomen was performed. A rectal tube was inserted in usual sterile fashion, and retrograde instillation of barium contrast was followed via spot fluoroscopic images. A post-evacuation overhead radiograph of the abdomen was performed.FINDINGS: The scout radiograph demonstrates a nonobstructive gastrointestinal pattern. There are no suspicious calcifications seen or evidence of gross free intraperitoneal air. The visualized lung bases and osseous structures are within normal limits.The rectum and colon is of normal caliber throughout its course. There is no evidence of obstruction, as contrast is seen to flow without difficulty into the right colon and cecum. A small amount of contrast is seen to opacify small bowel loops on the post-evacuation image. There is also opacification of a normal-appearing appendix documented.IMPRESSION: Normal barium enema."
14,Gastroenterology,"The patient is a 60-year-old male, who self-reported history of head and neck cancer status post 35 radiation treatments and 6 weeks of chemotherapy between March 2008 and July 2008. The patient was referred for an outpatient speech and language pathology consult to increase speech and swallowing abilities. The patient is currently NPO with G-tube to meet all of his hydration and nutritional needs. He has been NPO since April 2008. The patient also has a trach, which she is currently using finger occlusion to achieve voicing.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lortab.PREVIOUS MEDICAL HISTORY: Cardiac stent in 2000.PATIENT'S GOAL: To eat again by mouth.STUDY: A trial of Passy-Muir valve was completed to allow the patient to achieve hands-free voicing and also to improve his secretion management. A clinical swallow evaluation was not completed due to the severity of the patient's mucus and lack of saliva control.The patient's laryngeal area was palpated during a dry swallow and he does have significantly reduced laryngeal elevation and radiation fibrosis. The further evaluate of his swallowing function is safety; a modified barium swallow study needs to be concluded to objectively evaluate his swallow safety, and to rule out aspiration. A trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy was completed to determine if this therapy protocol will be beneficial and improving the patient's swallowing function and safety.For his neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy, the type was BMR with a single mode cycle time is 4 seconds and 12 seconds off with frequency was 60 __________ with a ramp of 2 seconds, phase duration was 220 with an output of 99 milliamps. Electrodes were placed on the suprahyoid/submandibular triangle with an upright body position, trial length was 10 minutes. On a pain scale, the patient reported no pain with the electrical stimulation therapy.FINDINGS: The patient was able to tolerate a 5-minute placement of the Passy-Muir valve. He reported no discomfort on the inhalation; however, he felt some resistance on exhalation. Instructions were given on care placement and cleaning of the Passy-Muir valve. The patient was instructed to buildup tolerance over the next several days of his Passy-Muir valve and to remove the valve at anytime or he is going to be sleeping or napping throughout the day. The patient's voicing did improve with the Passy-Muir valve due to decreased leakage from his trach secondary to finger occlusion. Mucus production also seemed to decrease when the Passy-Muir was placed.On the dry swallow during this evaluation, the patient's laryngeal area is reduced and tissues around his larynx and showed radiation fibrosis. The patient's neck range of motion appears to be adequate and within normal limits.A trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy:The patient tolerating the neuromuscular electrical stimulation, we did achieve poor passive response, but these muscles were contracting and the larynx was moving upon stimulation. The patient was able to actively swallow with stimulation approximately 30% of presentation.DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: The patient with a history of head and neck cancer status post radiation and chemotherapy with radiation fibrosis, which is impeding his swallowing abilities. The patient would benefit from outpatient skilled speech therapy for neuromuscular electrical stimulation for muscle reeducation to improve his swallowing function and safety and he would benefit from a placement of a Passy-Muir valve to have hands-free communication.PLAN OF CARE: Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week to include neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy, Passy-Muir placement and a completion of the modified barium swallow study.SHORT-TERM GOALS (6 WEEKS):1. Completion of modified barium swallow study.2. The patient will coordinate volitional swallow with greater than 75% of the neuromuscular electrical stimulations.3. The patient will increase laryngeal elevation by 50% for airway protection.4. The patient will tolerate placement of Passy-Muir valve for greater than 2 hours during awaking hours.5. The patient will tolerate therapeutic feedings with the speech and language pathologist without signs and symptoms of aspiration.6. The patient will decrease mild facial restrictions to the anterior neck by 50% to increase laryngeal movement.LONG-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS):1. The patient will improve secretion management to tolerable levels.2. The patient will increase amount and oral consistency of p.o. intake tolerated without signs and symptoms of aspirations.3. The patient will be able to communicate without using finger occlusion with the assistance of a Passy-Muir valve."
15,Gastroenterology,"SUBJECTIVE: The patient is a 60-year-old female, who complained of coughing during meals. Her outpatient evaluation revealed a mild-to-moderate cognitive linguistic deficit, which was completed approximately 2 months ago. The patient had a history of hypertension and TIA/stroke. The patient denied history of heartburn and/or gastroesophageal reflux disorder. A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.OBJECTIVE: Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. ABC. The patient was seated upright in a video imaging chair throughout this assessment. To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); puree consistency (teaspoon x2); and solid food consistency (1/4 cracker x1).ASSESSMENTORAL STAGE: Premature spillage to the level of the valleculae and pyriform sinuses with thin liquid. Decreased tongue base retraction, which contributed to vallecular pooling after the swallow.PHARYNGEAL STAGE: No aspiration was observed during this evaluation. Penetration was noted with cup sips of thin liquid only. Trace residual on the valleculae and on tongue base with nectar-thick puree and solid consistencies. The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement are within functional limits. Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus. Radiologist noted reduced peristaltic action of the constricted muscles in the esophagus, which may be contributing to the patient's complaint of globus sensation.DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: No aspiration was noted during this evaluation. Penetration with cup sips of thin liquid. The patient did cough during this evaluation, but that was noted related to aspiration or penetration.PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: Based on this evaluation, the prognosis for swallowing and safety is good.PLAN: Based on this evaluation and following recommendations are being made:1. The patient to take small bite and small sips to help decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration.2. The patient should remain upright at a 90-degree angle for at least 45 minutes after meals to decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration as well as to reduce her globus sensation.3. The patient should be referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation of her esophageal function.The patient does not need any skilled speech therapy for her swallowing abilities at this time, and she is discharged from my services."
16,Gastroenterology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 71-year-old female, who was referred for an outpatient modified barium swallow study to objectively evaluate her swallowing function and safety. The patient complained of globus sensation high in her throat particularly with solid foods and with pills. She denied history of coughing and chocking with meals. The patient's complete medical history is unknown to me at this time. The patient was cooperative and compliant throughout this evaluation.STUDY: Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright at a 90-degree angle in a video imaging chair. To evaluate her swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of food and liquid mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3. cup sip x4); thickened liquid (cup sip x3); puree consistency (teaspoon x3); and solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1). The patient was given 2 additional cup sips of thin liquid following the puree and solid food presentation.ORAL STAGE: The patient had no difficulty with bolus control and transport. No spillage out lips. The patient appears to have pocketing __________ particularly with puree and solid food between her right faucial pillars. The patient did state that she had her tonsil taken out as a child and appears to be a diverticulum located in this state. Further evaluation by an ENT is highly recommended based on the residual and pooling that occurred during this evaluation. We were not able to clear out the residual with alternating cup sips and thin liquid.PHARYNGEAL STAGE: No aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation. The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movements are within the functional limits. Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits. She had no residual or pooling in the pharynx after the swallow.CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: The patient had no aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation. She does appear to have a diverticulum in the area between her right faucial pillars. Additional evaluation is needed by an ENT physician.PLAN: Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:1. The patient's diet should consist regular consistency food with thin liquids. She needs to take small bites and small sips to help decrease her risk of aspiration and penetration as well as reflux.2. The patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation of her oral cavity particularly the area between her faucial pillars.The above recommendations and results of the evaluation were discussed with the patient as well as her daughter and both responded appropriately.Thank you for the opportunity to be required the patient's medical care. She is not in need of skilled speech therapy and is discharged from my services."
17,Gastroenterology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 76-year-old male, with previous history of dysphagia, status post stroke. The patient stated that he was at Hospital, secondary to his stroke, where he had his initial modified barium swallow study. The patient stated that the results of that modified revealed aspiration with thin liquids only. He is currently eating and drinking without difficulty and he feels that he can return to a regular diet with thin liquids. A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.STUDY: Modified barium swallow study was performed in the radiology suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright and in a video-imaging chair throughout this assessment.To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, he was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3, cup sip x3); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x3); pureed consistency (teaspoon x3); solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).FINDINGSORAL STAGE: The patient had no spillage out lips. Oral residual after swallow with increased viscosity requiring multiple swallows to clear oral cavity.The patient has reduced lingual retraction contributing to vallecula pooling after the swallow. Trace premature spillage was noted with thin liquids during this assessment.PHARYNGEAL STAGE: Aspiration noted on cup sips of thin liquid. Trace-to-mild penetration with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid during and after the swallow. The penetration after the swallow occurred secondary to spillage on the piriform sinuses into the laryngeal vestibule. The patient has incomplete laryngeal closure, which allowed the aspiration and penetration with thin liquids. The patient had no aspiration or penetration occur with nectar-thick liquid, puree, and solid food. The patient has a mildly reduced hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement that leads to incomplete epiglottic inversion that contributes to vallecula pooling. Mild-to-moderate pooling in the vallecula after the swallow with liquids and puree, this residual did decrease with the solid feed presentation. The patient has mild residual of pooling in the piriform sinuses after a swallow that did clear with sequential swallows.CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: Mild aspiration with cup sips of thin liquid, penetration during and after the swallow with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid. No aspiration or penetration occurred with thick liquid, pureed, or solid food during this assessment.PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: With a modified diet, the patient's potential for swallowing safety is good.PLAN:Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:1. The patient should be on a regular diet with nectar-thick liquids to help prevent aspiration and penetration.2. The patient should have unthickened water in between meals to help decrease his risk of dehydration.3. The patient should complete good oral care two times a day to decrease bacterial growth in mouth.4. The patient should be seated at a 90-degree angle when eating and drinking, as well as take small bites and small sips to help decrease risk of aspiration and penetration and reflux.Thank you for the opportunity to evaluate the patient. I look forward to working with him in the outpatient setting to improve his swallowing function and safety. Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended for a trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy for muscle re-education, as well as to train patient to use swallowing techniques and maneuvers that should improve his swallowing function and safety."
18,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hematemesis in a patient with longstanding diabetes. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Mallory-Weiss tear, submucosal hemorrhage consistent with trauma from vomiting and grade 2 esophagitis.PROCEDURE: The procedure, indications explained and he understood and agreed. He was sedated with Versed 3, Demerol 25 and topical Hurricane spray to the oropharynx. A bite block was placed. The Pentax video gastroscope was advanced through the oropharynx into the esophagus under direct vision. Esophagus revealed distal ulcerations. Additionally, the patient had a Mallory-Weiss tear. This was subjected to bicap cautery with good ablation. The stomach was entered, which revealed areas of submucosal hemorrhage consistent with trauma from vomiting. There were no ulcerations or erosions in the stomach. The duodenum was entered, which was unremarkable. The instrument was then removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.IMPRESSION: Mallory-Weiss tear, successful BICAP cautery. We will keep the patient on proton pump inhibitors. The patient will remain on antiemetics and be started on a clear liquid diet."
19,Gastroenterology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Blood in toilet.HISTORY: Ms. ABC is a 77-year-old female who is brought down by way of ambulance from XYZ Nursing Home after nursing staff had noted there to be blood in the toilet after she had been sitting on the toilet. They did not note any urine or stool in the toilet and the patient had no acute complaints. The patient is unfortunately a poor historian in that she has dementia and does not recall any of the events. The patient herself has absolutely no complaints, such as abdominal pain or back pain, urinary and GI complaints. There is no other history provided by the nursing staff from XYZ. There apparently were no clots noted within there. She does not have a history of being on anticoagulants.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Actually quite limited, includes that of dementia, asthma, anemia which is chronic, hypothyroidism, schizophrenia, positive PPD in the past.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Unknown.SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco or alcohol.MEDICATIONS: Listed in the medical records.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Stable.GENERAL: This is a well-nourished, well-developed female who is alert, oriented in all spheres, pleasant, cooperative, resting comfortably, appearing otherwise healthy and well in no acute distress.HEENT: Visually normal.

Guaiac was done and was trace positive. Visual examination anteriorly during the rectal examination noted no blood within the vaginal region.EXTREMITIES: No significant abnormalities.WORKUP: CT abdomen and pelvis was negative. CBC was entirely within normal limits without any signs of anemia with an H and H of 14 and 42%. CMP also within normal limits. PTT, PT, and INR were normal. Attempts at getting the patient to give A urine were unsuccessful and the patient was very noncompliant, would not allow us to do any kind of Foley catheterization.ER COURSE: Uneventful. I have discussed the patient in full with Dr. X who agrees that she does not require any further workup or evaluation as an inpatient. We have decided to send the patient back to XYZ with observation by the staff there. She will have a CBC done daily for the next 3 days with results to Dr. X. They are to call him if there is any recurrences of blood or worsening of symptoms and they are to do a urinalysis at XYZ for blood.ASSESSMENT: Questionable gastrointestinal bleeding at this time, stable without any obvious signs otherwise of significant bleed."
20,Gastroenterology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Bright red blood per rectum HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 73-year-old woman had a recent medical history significant for renal and bladder cancer, deep venous thrombosis of the right lower extremity, and anticoagulation therapy complicated by lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Colonoscopy during that admission showed internal hemorrhoids and diverticulosis, but a bleeding site was not identified. Five days after discharge to a nursing home, she again experienced bloody bowel movements and returned to the emergency department for evaluation. REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS: No chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain or cramping, nausea, vomiting, or lightheadedness. Positive for generalized weakness and diarrhea the day of admission. PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY: Long-standing hypertension, intermittent atrial fibrillation, and hypercholesterolemia. Renal cell carcinoma and transitional cell bladder cancer status post left nephrectomy, radical cystectomy, and ileal loop diversion 6 weeks prior to presentation, postoperative course complicated by pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and retroperitoneal bleed.

FAMILY HISTORY: Non-contributory.PHYSICAL EXAM: Temp = 38.3C BP =146/52 HR= 113 RR = 18 SaO2 = 98% room air General: Pale, ill-appearing elderly female. HEENT: Pale conjunctivae, oral mucous membranes moist. CVS: Irregularly irregular, tachycardia. Lungs: Decreased breath sounds at the bases. Abdomen: Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, gross blood on rectal exam. Extremities: No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. Skin: Warm, normal turgor. Neuro: Alert and oriented. Nonfocal. LABS: CBC: WBC count: 6,500 per mL Hemoglobin: 10.3 g/dL Hematocrit:31.8% Platelet count: 248 per mL Mean corpuscular volume: 86.5 fL RDW: 18% CHEM 7: Sodium: 131 mmol/L Potassium: 3.5 mmol/L Chloride: 98 mmol/L Bicarbonate: 23 mmol/L BUN: 11 mg/dL Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL Glucose: 105 mg/dL COAGULATION STUDIES: PT 15.7 sec INR 1.6 PTT 29.5 sec HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient received 1 liter normal saline and diltiazem (a total of 20 mg intravenously and 30 mg orally) in the emergency department. Emergency department personnel made several attempts to place a nasogastric tube for gastric lavage, but were unsuccessful. During her evaluation, the patient was noted to desaturate to 80% on room air, with an increase in her respiratory rate to 34 breaths per minute. She was administered 50% oxygen by nonrebreadier mask, with improvement in her oxygen saturation to 89%. Computed tomographic angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism. The patient was admitted to the medicine service for further workup and management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypoxia. She was alert, awake, and hemodynamically stable, but remained tachypneic and hypoxic despite high-flow oxygen. She continued to perseverate on the fact that she had been unable to swallow the nasogastric tube earlier in the evening ""even with that banana spray"" (topical benzocaine 20%). While obtaining a sample for arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, the medical team noted that the blood was abnormally dark. The sample was sent for co-oximetry as well, which revealed a methemoglobin level of 15.2%. ABG showed a pH of 7.41, PCO2 31 mmHg, PO2 374 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient was treated with methylene blue, with rapid resolution of tachypnea and improvement of oxygen saturation to 97% on 2 liters nasal cannula."
21,Gastroenterology,"REASON FOR CONSULT: I was asked to see the patient for C. diff colitis.HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: Briefly, the patient is a very pleasant 72-year-old female with previous history of hypertension and also recent diagnosis of C. diff for which she was admitted here in 5/2009, who presents to the hospital on 6/18/2009 with abdominal pain, cramping, and persistent diarrhea. After admission, she had a CT of the abdomen done, which showed evidence of diffuse colitis and she was started on IV Flagyl and also on IV Levaquin. She was also placed on IV Reglan because of nausea and vomiting. In spite of the above, her white count still continues to be elevated today. On questioning the patient, she states the nausea and vomiting has resolved, but the diarrhea still present, but otherwise denies any other specific complaints except for some weakness.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent C. diff colitis, which had resolved based on speaking to Dr. X. Two weeks ago, he had seen the patient and she was clinically well.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Noncontributory.SOCIAL HISTORY: No history of smoking, alcohol, or drug use. She lives at home.HOME MEDICATIONS: She is on atenolol and Mevacor.ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for diarrhea and abdominal pain, otherwise main other complaints are weakness. She denies any cough, sputum production, or dysuria at this time. Otherwise, a 10-system review is essentially negative.PHYSICAL EXAM:GENERAL: She is awake and alert, currently in no apparent distress.VITAL SIGNS: She has been afebrile since admission, temperature today 96.5, heart rate 80, respirations 18, blood pressure 125/60, and O2 sat is 98% on 2 L.HEENT: Pupils are round and reactive to light and accommodation.CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.CARDIOVASCULAR: S1 and S2 are present. No rales appreciated.ABDOMEN: She does have tenderness to palpation all over with some mild rebound tenderness also. No guarding noted. Bowel sounds present.EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.CT of the abdomen and pelvis is also reviewed on the computer, which showed evidence of diffuse colitis.LABORATORY: White blood cell count today 21.5, hemoglobin 12.4, platelet count 284,000, and neutrophils 89. UA on 6/18/2009 showed no evidence of UTI. Sodium today 130, potassium 2.7, and creatinine 0.4. AST and ALT on 6/20/2009 were normal. Blood cultures from admission were negative. Urine culture on admission was negative. C. diff was positive. Stool culture was negative.ASSESSMENT:1. A 72-year-old female with Clostridium difficile colitis.2. Diarrhea secondary to above and also could be related Reglan, which was discontinued today.3. Leukocytosis secondary to above, mild improvement today though.4. Bilateral pleural effusion by CT of the chest, although could represent thickening.5. New requirement for oxygen, rule out pneumonia.6. Hypertension.PLAN:1. Treat the C. diff aggressively especially given CT appearance and her continued leukocytosis and because of the Levaquin, which could have added additional antibiotic pressure, so I will restart the IV Flagyl.2. Continue p.o. vancomycin. Add Florastor to help replenish the gut flora.3. Monitor WBCs closely and follow clinically and if there is any deterioration in her clinical status, I would recommend getting surgical evaluation immediately for surgery if needed.4. We will check a chest x-ray especially given her new requirement for oxygen."
22,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cecal polyp.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cecal polyp.PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic resection of cecal polyp.COMPLICATIONS: None.ANESTHESIA: General oral endotracheal intubation.PROCEDURE: After adequate general anesthesia was administered the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped aseptically. Local anesthetic was infiltrated into the right upper quadrant where a small incision was made. Blunt dissection was carried down to the fascia which was grasped with Kocher clamps. A bladed 11-mm port was inserted without difficulty. Pneumoperitoneum was obtained using C02. Under direct vision 2 additional, non-bladed, 11-mm trocars were placed, one in the left lower quadrant and one in the right lower quadrant. There was some adhesion noted to the anterior midline which was taken down using the harmonic scalpel. The cecum was visualized and found to have tattoo located almost opposite the ileocecal valve. This was in what appeared to be an appropriate location for removal of this using the Endo GIA stapler without impinging on the ileocecal valve or the appendiceal orifice. The appendix was somewhat retrocecal in position but otherwise looked normal. The patient was also found to have ink marks in the peritoneal cavity diffusely indicating possible extravasation of dye. There was enough however in the wall to identify the location of the polyp. The lesion was grasped with a Babcock clamp and an Endo GIA stapler used to fire across this transversely. The specimen was then removed through the 12-mm port and examined on the back table. The lateral margin was found to be closely involved with the specimen so I did not feel that it was clear. I therefore lifted the lateral apex of the previous staple line and created a new staple line extending more laterally around the colon. This new staple line was then opened on the back table and examined. There was some residual polypoid material noted but the margins this time appeared to be clear. The peritoneal cavity was then lavaged with antibiotic solution. There were a few small areas of bleeding along the staple line which were treated with pinpoint electrocautery. The trocars were removed under direct vision. No bleeding was noted. The bladed trocar site was closed using a figure-of-eight O Vicryl suture. All skin incisions were closed with running 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures. Mastisol and Steri-Strips were placed followed by sterile Tegaderm dressing. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications."
23,Gastroenterology,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Newly diagnosed cholangiocarcinoma.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a very pleasant 77-year-old female who is noted to have an increase in her liver function tests on routine blood work in December 2009. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge and gallbladder findings consistent with adenomyomatosis. Common bile duct was noted to be 10 mm in size on that ultrasound. She then underwent a CT scan of the abdomen in July 2010, which showed intrahepatic ductal dilatation with the common bile duct size being 12.7 mm. She then underwent an MRI MRCP, which was notable for stricture of the distal common bile duct. She was then referred to gastroenterology and underwent an ERCP. On August 24, 2010, she underwent the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. She was noted to have a stricturing mass of the mid-to-proximal common bile duct consistent with cholangiocarcinoma. A temporary biliary stent was placed across the biliary stricture. Blood work was obtained during the hospitalization. She was also noted to have an elevated CA99. She comes in to clinic today for initial Medical Oncology consultation. After she sees me this morning, she has a follow-up consultation with a surgeon.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In July, she had eye surgery on her left eye for a muscle repair. Other surgeries include left ankle surgery for a fractured ankle in 2000.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Diovan 80/12.5 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, Lutein 20 mg daily, folic acid 0.8 mg daily and multivitamin daily.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for heart disease. She had three brothers that died of complications from open heart surgery. Her parents and brothers all had hypertension. Her younger brother died at the age of 18 of infection from a butcher's shop. He was cutting Argentinean beef and contracted an infection and died within 24 hours. She has one brother that is living who has angina and a sister who is 84 with dementia. She has two adult sons who are in good health.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has been married to her second husband for the past ten years. Her first husband died in 1995. She does not have a smoking history and does not drink alcohol.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient reports a change in her bowels ever since she had the stent placed. She has noted some weight loss, but she notes that that is due to not eating very well. She has had some mild fatigue, but prior to her diagnosis she had absolutely no symptoms. As mentioned above, she was noted to have abnormal alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, AST and ALT, which prompted the followup. She has had some difficulty with her vision that has improved with her recent surgical procedure. She denies any fevers, chills, night sweats. She has had loose stools. The rest of her review of systems is negative.PHYSICAL EXAM:VITALS: BP: 108/60. HEART RATE: 80. TEMP: 98.5. Weight: 75 kg.GEN: She is a very pleasant female, in no acute distress.HEENT: She has obvious strabismus of the left eye with medial deviation. Her pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Oropharynx is clear.NECK: Supple. She has no cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy.LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.CV: Regular rate; normal S1, S2, no murmurs.ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended. No palpable masses. No hepatosplenomegaly.EXT: Lower extremities are without edema.LABORATORY STUDIES: Sodium 141, glucose 111, total bilirubin 2.3, alkaline phosphatase 941, AST 161, and ALT 220. White blood cell count 4.3, hemoglobin 11.6, hematocrit 35, and platelets 156,000. Total bilirubin from August 25, 2010 was 1.6, alkaline phosphatase 735, AST 123, ALT 184, CA99 is 109. Bile duct brushings are notable for atypical cell clusters present, highly suspicious for carcinoma.ASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a very pleasant 77-year-old female who has findings suspicious for a cholangiocarcinoma. The patient was referred to our office to discuss this diagnosis. I spent greater than an hour with the patient and her husband discussing this potential diagnosis, reviewing the anatomy and answering questions. She is yet to have a surgical consultation, and we discussed the difficulty that we sometimes have with patients meeting surgical criteria to manage cholangiocarcinoma. The patient also had questions about the Medical University and possibly seeking a second opinion. She will contact our office after her surgical consultation if she needs assistance with obtaining a second opinion. We also talked about our clinical research program here. Currently, we do have a Phase II Study for advanced gallbladder carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma for patients that are unresectable. We will go ahead and provide her with a consent form so that she can look that over and it will give her some more information about the malignancy and treatment approaches. We will schedule her for followup in three weeks. We will also schedule her for PET/CT scan for staging."
24,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):1. Cholelithiasis.2. Cholecystitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):1. Acute perforated gangrenous cholecystitis.2. Cholelithiasis.PROCEDURE:1. Attempted laparoscopic cholecystectomy.2. Open cholecystectomy.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia.COUNTS: Correct.COMPLICATIONS: None apparent.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 275 mL.SPECIMENS:1. Gallbladder.2. Lymph node.DRAINS: One 19-French round Blake.DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION: After consent was obtained and the patient was properly identified, the patient was transported to the operating room and after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a normal sterile fashion.After infiltration with local, a vertical incision was made at the umbilicus and utilizing graspers, the underlying fascia was incised and was divided sharply. Dissecting further, the peritoneal cavity was entered. Once this done, a Hasson trocar was secured with #1 Vicryl and the abdomen was insufflated without difficulty. A camera was placed into the abdomen and there was noted to be omentum overlying the subhepatic space. A second trocar was placed in the standard fashion in the subxiphoid area; this was a 10/12 mm non-bladed trocar. Once this was done, a grasper was used to try and mobilize the omentum and a second grasper was added in the right costal margin; this was a 5-mm port placed, it was non-bladed and placed in the usual fashion under direct visualization without difficulty. A grasper was used to mobilize free the omentum which was acutely friable and after a significant time-consuming effort was made to mobilize the omentum, it was clear that the gallbladder was well incorporated by the omentum and it would be unsafe to proceed with a laparoscopy procedure and then the procedure was converted to open.The trocars were removed and a right subcostal incision was made incorporating the 10/12 subxiphoid port. The subcutaneous space was divided with electrocautery, as well as the muscles and fascia. The Bookwalter retraction system was then set up and retractors were placed to provide exposure to the right subhepatic space. Then utilizing a right-angle and electrocautery, the omentum was freed from the gallbladder. An ensuing retrograde cholecystectomy was performed, in which, electrocautery and blunt dissection were used to mobilize the gallbladder from the gallbladder fossa; this was done down to the infundibulum. After meticulous dissection, the cystic artery was identified and it was ligated between 3-0 silks. Several other small ties were placed on smaller bleeding vessels and the cystic duct was identified, was skeletonized, and a 3-0 stick tie was placed on the proximal portion of it. After it was divided, the gallbladder was freed from the field.Once this was done, the liver bed was inspected for hemostasis and this was achieved with electrocautery. Copious irrigation was also used. A 19-French Blake drain was placed in Morrison's pouch lateral to the gallbladder fossa and was secured in place with 2-0 nylon; this was a 19-French round Blake. Once this was done, the umbilical port was closed with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion and then the wound was closed in two layers with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion. The skin was closed with and absorbable stitch.The patient was then awakened from anesthesia, extubated, and transported to the recovery room in stable condition."
25,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Cholelithiasis.2. Acute cholecystitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Acute on chronic cholecystitis.2. Cholelithiasis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram.ANESTHESIA: General.INDICATIONS: This is a 38-year-old diabetic Hispanic female patient, with ongoing recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant pain, associated with nausea. Ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis. The patient also had somewhat thickened gallbladder wall. The patient was admitted through emergency room last night with acute onset right upper quadrant pain. Clinically, it was felt the patient had acute cholecystitis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram was advised. Procedure, indication, risk, and alternative were discussed with the patient in detail preoperatively and informed consent was obtained.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia, and abdomen was prepped and draped. A small transverse incision was made just above the umbilicus under local anesthesia. Fascia was opened vertically. Stay sutures were placed in the fascia. Peritoneal cavity was carefully entered. Hasson cannula was inserted and peritoneal cavity was insufflated with CO2.Laparoscopic camera was inserted, and the patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg, rotated to the left. A 11-mm trocar was placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5-mm in the right subcostal region. Examination at this time showed no free fluid, no acute inflammatory changes. Liver was grossly normal. Gallbladder was noted to be thickened. Gallbladder wall with a stone stuck in the neck of the gallbladder and pericholecystic edema, consistent with acute cholecystitis.The fundus of the gallbladder was retracted superiorly, and dissection was carried at the neck of the gallbladder where a cystic duct was identified and isolated. It was clipped distally and using C-arm fluoroscopy, intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram was done, which was interpreted as normal. There was slight dilatation noted at the junction of the right and left hepatic duct, but no filling defects or any other pathology was noted. It was presumed that this was probably a congenital anomaly. The cystic duct was clipped twice proximally and divided beyond the clips. Cystic artery was identified, isolated, clipped twice proximally, once distally, and divided.The gallbladder was then removed from its bed using cautery dissection and subsequently delivered through the umbilical port. Specimen was sent for histopathology. Subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic spaces were irrigated with sterile saline solution. Hemostasis was good. Trocars were removed under direct vision and peritoneal cavity was evacuated with CO2. Umbilical area fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl figure-of-eight sutures, required extra sutures to close the fascial defect. Some difficulty was encountered closing the fascia initially because of the patient's significant amount of subcutaneous fat. In the end, the repair appears to be quite satisfactory. Rest of the incisions closed with 3-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissues and staples for the skin. Sterile dressing was applied.The patient transferred to recovery room in stable condition."
26,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gallstone pancreatitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gallstone pancreatitis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal and local injectable Marcaine.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.SPECIMEN: Gallbladder.COMPLICATIONS: None.OPERATIVE FINDINGS: Video laparoscopy revealed dense omental adhesions surrounding the gallbladder circumferentially. These dense adhesions were associated with chronic inflammatory edematous changes. The cystic duct was easily identifiable and seen entering into the gallbladder and clipped two proximally and one distally. The cystic artery was an anomalous branch that was anterior to the cystic duct and was identified, clipped with two clips proximally and one distally. The remainder of the evaluation of the abdomen revealed no evidence of nodularity or masses in the liver. There was no evidence of adhesions from the abdominal wall to the liver. The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 17-year-old African-American female who presented to ABCD General Hospital on 08/20/2003 with complaints of intractable right upper quadrant abdominal pain. She had been asked to follow up and scheduled for surgery previously. Her pain had now been intractable associated with anorexia. She was noted on physical examination to be afebrile; however, she was having severe right upper quadrant pain with examination as well as a Murphy's sign and voluntary guarding with examination. Her transaminases were markedly elevated. She also developed pancreatitis secondary to gallstones. Her common bile duct was dilated to 1 cm with no evidence of wall thickening, but evidence of cholelithiasis. She was seen by the gastroenterologist and underwent a sphincterotomy with balloon extraction of gallstones secondary to choledocholithiasis. Following this, she was scheduled for operative laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Her parents were explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure. She gave us informed consent to proceed with surgery.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position. Preoperatively, the patient received IV antibiotics of Ancef, sequential compression devices and subcutaneous heparin. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution. Utilizing a #15 blade scalpel, a transverse infraumbilical incision was created. Utilizing a Veress needle with anterior traction on the anterior abdominal wall with a towel clamp, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty. Hanging water drop test was performed with notable air aspiration through the Veress needle and the saline passed through the Veress needle without difficulty. The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg with carbon-dioxide. Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a #10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty. Video laparoscope was inserted and the above notable findings were identified in the operative findings. The patient to proceed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy was decided and a subxiphoid port was placed. A #15 bladed scalpel was used to make a transverse incision in the subxiphoid region within the midline. The trocar was then inserted into the abdomen under direct visualization with the video laparoscope and seen to go to the right of falciform ligament. Next, two 5 mm trocars were inserted under direct visualization, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior midaxillary line. These were inserted without difficulty. The liver edge was lifted and revealed a markedly edematous gallbladder with severe omental adhesions encapsulating the gallbladder. Utilizing Endoshears scissor, a plane was created circumferentially to the dome of the gallbladder to allow assistance and dissection of these dense adhesions. Next, the omental adhesions adjacent to the infundibulum were taken down and allowed to expose the cystic duct. A small vessel was seen anterior to the cystic duct and this was clipped two proximally and one distally and noted to be an anomalous arterial branch. This was transected with Endoshears scissor and visualized the pulsatile branch with two clips securely in place. Next, the cystic duct was carefully dissected with Maryland dissectors and was visualized clearly both anterior and posteriorly. Endoclips were placed two proximally and one distally and then the cystic duct was transected with Endoshears scissor.Once the clips were noted to be in place, utilizing electrocautery another Dorsey dissector was used to carefully dissect the gallbladder off the liver bed wall. The gallbladder was removed and the bleeding from the gallbladder wall was easily controlled with electrocautery. The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline. The gallbladder was grasped with a gallbladder grasper and removed from the subxiphoid port. There was noted to be gallstones within the gallbladder. Once the abdomen was re-insufflated after removing the gallbladder and copious irrigation was performed, all ports were then removed under direct visualization with no evidence of bleeding from the anterior abdominal wall. Utilizing #0 Vicryl suture, a figure-of-eight was placed to the subxiphoid and infraumbilical fascia and this was approximated without difficulty. The subxiphoid port was irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline prior to closure of the fascia. A #4-0 Vicryl suture was used to approximate all incisions. The incisions were then injected with local injectable 0.25% Marcaine. All ports were then cleaned dry. Steri-Strips were placed across and sterile pressure dressings were placed on top of this. The patient tolerated the entire procedure well. She was transferred to the Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition. She will be followed closely in the postoperative course in General Medical Floor."
27,Gastroenterology,"REASON FOR ADMISSION: Cholecystitis with choledocholithiasis.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis.ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES1. Status post roux-en-y gastric bypass converted to an open procedure in 01/07.2. Laparoscopic paraventral hernia in 11/07.3. History of sleep apnea with reversal after 100-pound weight loss.4. Morbid obesity with bmi of 39.4.PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with laparoscopy converted to open common bile duct exploration and stone extraction.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 33-year-old female admitted with elevated bilirubin and probable common bile duct stone. She was admitted through the emergency room with abdominal pain, elevated bilirubin, and gallstones on ultrasound with a dilated common bile duct. She subsequently went for a HIDA scan to rule out cholecystitis. Gallbladder was filled but was unable to empty into the small bowel consistent with the common bile duct blockage. She was taken to the operating room that night for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We proceeded with laparoscopic cholecystectomy and during the cholangiogram there was no contrast. It was able to be extravasated into the duodenum with the filling defect consistent with the distal common bile duct stone. The patient had undergone a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass but could not receive an ERCP and stone extraction, therefore, common bile duct exploration was performed and a stone was extracted. This necessitated conversion to an open operation. She was transferred to the medical surgical unit postoperatively. She had a significant amount of incisional pain following morning, but no nausea. A Jackson-Pratt drain, which was left in place in two places showed serosanguineous fluid. White blood cell count was down to 7500 and bilirubin decreased to 2.1. Next morning she was started on a liquid diet. Foley catheter was discontinued. There was no evidence of bile leak from the drains. She was advanced to a regular diet on postoperative day #3, which was 12/09/07. The following morning she was tolerating regular diet. Her bowels had begun to function, and she was afebrile with her pain control with oral pain medications. Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued from the wound. The remaining Jackson-Pratt drain was left adjacent to her cystic duct. Following morning, her laboratory studies were better. Her bilirubin was down to normal and white blood cell count was normal with an H&H of 9 and 26.3. Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued, and she was discharged home. Followup was in 3 days for staple removal. She was given iron 325 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Lortab elixir 15 cc p.o. q.4 h. p.r.n. for pain."
28,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute acalculous cholecystitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute acalculous cholecystitis.PROCEDURE: Placement of cholecystostomy tube under ultrasound guidance.ANESTHESIA: Xylocaine 1% With Epinephrine.INDICATIONS: Patient is a pleasant 75-year-old gentleman who is about one week status post an acute MI who also has acute cholecystitis. Because it is not safe to take him to the operating room for general anesthetic, I recommended he undergo the above-named procedure. Procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, and alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable to surgery.TECHNIQUE: Patient was identified, then taken to the Radiology suite, where the area of interest was identified using ultrasound and prepped with Betadine solution, draped in sterile fashion. After infiltration with 1% Xylocaine and after multiple attempts, the gallbladder was finally cannulated by Dr. Kindred using the Cook 18-French needle. The guidewire was then placed and via Seldinger technique, a 10-French pigtail catheter was placed within the gallbladder, secured using the Cook catheter method, and dressings were applied and patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition."

30,Gastroenterology,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: I was asked by Dr. X to see the patient in consultation for a new diagnosis of colon cancer.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient presented to medical attention after she noticed mild abdominal cramping in February 2007. At that time, she was pregnant and was unsure if her symptoms might have been due to the pregnancy. Unfortunately, she had miscarriage at about seven weeks. She again had abdominal cramping, severe, in late March 2007. She underwent colonoscopy on 04/30/2007 by Dr. Y. Of note, she is with a family history of early colon cancers and had her first colonoscopy at age 35 and no polyps were seen at that time.On colonoscopy, she was found to have a near-obstructing lesion at the splenic flexure. She was not able to have the scope passed past this lesion. Pathology showed a colon cancer, although I do not have a copy of that report at this time.She had surgical resection done yesterday. The surgery was laparoscopic assisted with anastomosis. At the time of surgery, lymph nodes were palpable.Pathology showed colon adenocarcinoma, low grade, measuring 3.8 x 1.7 cm, circumferential and invading in to the subserosal mucosa greater than 5 mm, 13 lymph nodes were negative for metastasis. There was no angiolymphatic invasion noted. Radial margin was 0.1 mm. Other margins were 5 and 6 mm. Testing for microsatellite instability is still pending.Staging has already been done with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This showed a mass at the splenic flexure, mildly enlarged lymph nodes there, and no evidence of metastasis to liver, lungs, or other organs. The degenerative changes were noted at L5-S1. The ovaries were normal. An intrauterine device (IUD) was present in the uterus.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She has otherwise been feeling well. She has not had fevers, night sweats, or noticed lymphadenopathy. She has not had cough, shortness of breath, back pain, bone pain, blood in her stool, melena, or change in stool caliber. She was eating well up until the time of her surgery. She is up-to-date on mammography, which will be due again in June. She has no history of pulmonary, cardiac, renal, hepatic, thyroid, or central nervous system (CNS) disease.ALLERGIES: PENICILLIN, WHICH CAUSED HIVES WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD.MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION: None.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: No significant medical problem. She has had three miscarriages, all of them at about seven weeks. She has no prior surgeries.SOCIAL HISTORY: She smoked cigarettes socially while in her 20s. A pack of cigarettes would last for more than a week. She does not smoke now. She has two glasses of wine per day, both red and white wine. She is married and has no children. An IUD was recently placed. She works as an esthetician.FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of stage IV colon cancer at age 45. This occurred when the patient was young and she is not sure of the rest of the paternal family history. She does believe that aunts and uncles on that side may have died early. Her brother died of pancreas cancer at age 44. Another brother is aged 52 and he had polyps on colonoscopy a couple of years ago. Otherwise, he has no medical problem. Mother is aged 82 and healthy. She was recently diagnosed with hemochromatosis.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: She is in no acute distress.VITAL SIGNS: The patient is afebrile with a pulse of 78, respirations 16, blood pressure 124/70, and pulse oximetry is 93% on 3 L of oxygen by nasal cannula.SKIN: Warm and dry. She has no jaundice.LYMPHATICS: No cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes are palpable.LUNGS: There is no respiratory distress.CARDIAC: Regular rate.ABDOMEN: Soft and mildly tender. Dressings are clean and dry.EXTREMITIES: No peripheral edema is noted. Sequential compression devices (SCDs) are in place.LABORATORY DATA: White blood count of 11.7, hemoglobin 12.8, hematocrit 37.8, platelets 408, differential shows left shift, MCV is 99.6. Sodium is 136, potassium 4.1, bicarb 25, chloride 104, BUN 5, creatinine 0.7, and glucose is 133. Calcium is 8.8 and magnesium is 1.8.IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Newly diagnosed stage II colon cancer, with a stage T3c, N0, M0 colon cancer, grade 1. She does not have high-risk factors such as high grade or angiolymphatic invasion, and adequate number of lymph nodes were sampled. Although, the tumor was near obstructing, she was not having symptoms and in fact was having normal bowel movements.A lengthy discussion was held with the patient regarding her diagnosis and prognosis. Firstly, she has a good prognosis for being cured without adjuvant therapy. I would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age. Referring to the database that had been online, she has a 13% chance of relapse in the next five years, and with aggressive chemotherapy (X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) platinum-based), this would be reduced to an 8% risk of relapse with a 5% benefit. Chemotherapy with 5-FU based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 2.5%.Plan was made to allow her to recuperate and then meet with her and her husband to discuss the pros and cons of adjuvant chemotherapy including what regimen she could consider including the side effects. We did not review all that information today.She has a family history of early colon cancer. Her mother will be visiting in the weekend and plan is to obtain the rest of the paternal family history if we can. Tumor is being tested for microsatellite instability and we will discuss this when those results are available. She has one sibling and he is up-to-date on colonoscopy. She does report multiple tubes of blood were drawn prior to her admission. I will check with Dr. Y's office whether she has had a CEA and liver-associated enzymes assessed. If not, those can be drawn tomorrow."

We will plan on proceeding with testing for adenomatous polyps. I will see her back in clinic once we get the results. I appreciate the referral."
33,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Iron deficiency anemia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diverticulosis.PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy.MEDICATIONS: MAC.PROCEDURE: The Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced into the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon to the cecum identified by the ileocecal valve and the appendiceal orifice. Preparation was good, although there was some residual material in the cecum that was difficult to clear completely. The mucosa was normal throughout the colon. No polyps or other lesions were identified, and no blood was noted. Some diverticula were seen of the sigmoid colon with no luminal narrowing or evidence of inflammation. A retroflex view of the anorectal junction showed no hemorrhoids. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.FINAL DIAGNOSES:1. Diverticulosis in the sigmoid.2. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to the cecum.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Follow up with Dr. X as needed.2. Screening colonoscopy in 2 years.3. Additional evaluation for other causes of anemia may be appropriate."
34,Gastroenterology,"INDICATION: Rectal bleeding, constipation, abnormal CT scan, rule out inflammatory bowel disease.PREMEDICATION: See procedure nurse NCS form.PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the left lateral position and the above medications were titrated with adequate sedation. Monitoring was provided throughout the entire procedure. Digital rectal exam was performed revealing normal sphincter tone and no external hemorrhoids. The Pentax video colonoscope was inserted into rectum and advanced under direct visualization, without difficulty, to the cecum, where the cecal strap, appendiceal orifice, and the ileocecal valve were identified. The quality of the preparation was good. The colonoscope was then withdrawn while carefully examining the mucosa.The colonic mucosa appeared normal with normal vascularity and haustral markings. No masses, polyps, AVM/s or diverticula were seen. On retroflexed view in the rectum, there are small internal hemorrhoids.The endoscope was removed and the procedure terminated. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.IMPRESSION: 1. Small internal hemorrhoids.2. Otherwise normal colonoscopy.PLAN: Continue fiber, increase to two tablets twice a day for a total of four tablets. Also try NuLev. FOLLOWUP: In the office in approximately four weeks if her symptoms do not resolve."
35,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Colon cancer screening and family history of polyps.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Colonic polyps.PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy.ANESTHESIA: MACDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced into the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon into the cecum and then through the ileocecal valve into the terminal ileum. The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen. The mucosa was normal throughout the colon and in the terminal ileum. Two polyps were identified and were removed. The first was a 7-mm sessile lesion in the mid transverse colon at 110 cm, removed with the snare without cautery and retrieved. The second was a small 4-mm sessile lesion in the sigmoid colon at 20 cm also removed with the snare and retrieved. No other lesions were identified. Numerous diverticula were found in the sigmoid colon. A retroflex through the anorectal junction showed moderate internal hemorrhoids. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.FINAL DIAGNOSES:1. Sigmoid diverticulosis.2. Colonic polyps in the transverse colon and sigmoid colon, benign appearance, removed.3. Internal hemorrhoids.4. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to the terminal ileum.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Follow up biopsy report.2. Follow up with Dr. X as needed.3. Screening colonoscopy in 5 years."
36,Gastroenterology,"MEDICATIONS:1. Versed intravenously.2. Demerol intravenously.DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and sedated with the above medications. The Olympus video colonoscope was inserted through the anus and was advanced in retrograde fashion through the sigmoid colon, descending colon, around the splenic flexure, into the transverse colon, around the hepatic flexure, down the ascending colon, into the cecum. The cecum was identified by the presence of the appendiceal orifice and the ileocecal valve. The colonoscope was then advanced through the ileocecal valve into the terminal ileum, which was normal on examination. The scope was then pulled back into the cecum and then slowly withdrawn. The mucosa was examined in detail. The mucosa was entirely normal. Upon reaching the rectum, retroflex examination of the rectum was normal. The scope was then straightened out, the air removed and the scope withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no apparent complications."
37,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Following instructions and completion of an oral colonoscopy prep, the patient, having been properly informed of, with signature consenting to total colonoscopy and indicated procedures, the patient received premedications of Vistaril 50 mg, Atropine 0.4 mg IM, and then intravenous medications of Demerol 50 mg and Versed 5 mg IV. Perirectal inspection was normal. The Olympus video colonoscope then was introduced into the rectum and passed by directed vision to the cecum and into the terminal ileum. No abnormalities were seen of the terminal ileum, the ileocecal valve, cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, descending colon, rectosigmoid and rectum. Retroflexion exam in the rectum revealed no other abnormality and withdrawal terminated the procedure."
38,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: History of polyps.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Normal colonoscopy, left colonic diverticular disease.2. 3+ benign prostatic hypertrophy.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Total colonoscopy and photography.GROSS FINDINGS: This is a 74-year-old white male here for recheck colonoscopy for a history of polyps. After signed informed consent, blood pressure monitoring, EKG monitoring, and pulse oximetry monitoring, he was brought to the Endoscopic Suite. He was given 100 mg of Demerol, 3 mg of Versed IV push slowly. Digital examination revealed a large prostate for which he is following up with his urologist. No nodules. 3+ BPH. Anorectal canal was within normal limits. No stricture tumor or ulcer. The Olympus CF 20L video endoscope was inserted per anus. The anorectal canal was visualized, was normal. The sigmoid, descending, splenic, and transverse showed scattered diverticula. The hepatic, ascending, cecum, and ileocecal valve was visualized and was normal. The colonoscope was removed. The air was aspirated. The patient was discharged with high-fiber, diverticular diet. Recheck colonoscopy three years."
39,Gastroenterology,"PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: History of colon polyps and partial colon resection, right colon.POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSES: 1. Normal operative site. 2. Mild diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. 3. Hemorrhoids.PROCEDURE: Total colonoscopy.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient is a 60-year-old of Dr. ABC's being evaluated for the above. The patient also apparently had an x-ray done at the Hospital and it showed a dark spot, and because of this, a colonoscopy was felt to be needed. She was prepped the night before and on the morning of the test with oral Fleet's, brought to the second floor and sedated with a total of 50 mg of Demerol and 3.75 mg of Versed IV push. Digital rectal exam was done, unremarkable. At that point, the Pentax video colonoscope was inserted. The rectal vault appeared normal. The sigmoid showed diverticula throughout, mild to moderate in nature. The scope was then passed through the descending and transverse colon over to the hepatic flexure area and then the anastomosis site was visualized. The scope was passed a short distance up the ileum, which appeared normal. The scope was then withdrawn through the transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectal vault area. The scope was then retroflexed, and anal verge visualized showed some hemorrhoids. The scope was then removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well.RECOMMENDATIONS: Repeat colonoscopy in three years."
40,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Change in bowel habits and rectal prolapse.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Normal colonoscopy.PROCEDURE: The Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon to the cecum identified by the ileocecal valve and the appendiceal orifice. The preparation was poor, but mucosa was visible after lavage and suction. Small lesions might have been missed in certain places, but no large lesions are likely to have been missed. The mucosa was normal, was visualized. In particular, there was no mucosal abnormality in the rectum and distal sigmoid, which is reported to be prolapsing. Biopsies were taken from the rectal wall to look for microscopic changes. The anal sphincter was considerably relaxed, with no tone and a gaping opening. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room.FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Normal colonic mucosa to the cecum. No contraindications to consideration of a repair of the prolapse."
41,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Rectal bleeding and perirectal abscess.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Perianal abscess.MEDICATIONS: MAC.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon into the cecum and then through the ileocecal valve into the terminal ileum. The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen. The mucosa throughout the colon and in the terminal ileum was normal, with no evidence of colitis. Special attention was paid to the rectum, including retroflexed views of the distal rectum and the anorectal junction. There was no evidence of either inflammation or a fistulous opening. The scope was withdrawn. A careful exam of the anal canal and perianal area demonstrated a jagged 8-mm opening at the anorectal junction posteriorly (12 o'clock position). Some purulent material could be expressed through the opening. There was no suggestion of significant perianal reservoir of inflamed tissue or undrained material. Specifically, the posterior wall of the distal rectum and anal canal were soft and unremarkable. In addition, scars were noted in the perianal area. The first was a small dimpled scar, 1 cm from the anal verge in the 11 o'clock position. The second was a dimpled scar about 5 cm from the anal verge on the left buttock's cheek. There were no other abnormalities noted. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.FINAL DIAGNOSES:1. Normal colonoscopy to the terminal ileum.2. Opening in the skin at the external anal verge, consistent with drainage from a perianal abscess, with no palpable abscess at this time, and with no evidence of fistulous connection to the bowel lumen.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Continue antibiotics.2. Followup with Dr. X.3. If drainage persists, consider surgical drainage."
42,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Colon polyps.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Universal diverticulosis.2. Nonsurgical internal hemorrhoids.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Total colonoscopy with photos.ANESTHESIA: Demerol 100 mg IV with Versed 3 mg IV.SPECIMENS: None.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 62-year-old white male who presents to the office with a history of colon polyps and need for recheck.PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained. All risks and benefits of the procedure were explained and all questions were answered. The patient was brought back to the Endoscopy Suite where he was connected to cardiopulmonary monitoring. Demerol 100 mg IV and Versed 3 mg IV was given in a titrated fashion until appropriate anesthesia was obtained. Upon appropriate anesthesia, a digital rectal exam was performed, which showed no masses. The colonoscope was then placed into the anus and the air was insufflated. The scope was then advanced under direct vision into the rectum, rectosigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon until it reached the cecum. Upon entering the sigmoid colon and throughout the rest of the colon, there was noted diverticulosis. After reaching the cecum, the scope was fully withdrawn visualizing all walls again noting universal diverticulosis.Upon reaching the rectum, the scope was then retroflexed upon itself and there was noted to be nonsurgical internal hemorrhoids. The scope was then subsequently removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications."
43,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Possible inflammatory bowel disease.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Polyp of the sigmoid colon.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Total colonoscopy with photography and polypectomy.GROSS FINDINGS: The patient had a history of ischiorectal abscess. He has been evaluated now for inflammatory bowel disease. Upon endoscopy, the colon prep was good. We were able to reach the cecum without difficulty. There are no diverticluli, inflammatory bowel disease, strictures, or obstructing lesions. There was a pedunculated polyp approximately 4.5 cm in size located in the sigmoid colon at approximately 35 cm. This large polyp was removed using the snare technique.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the endoscopy suite, prepped and draped in left lateral decubitus position. IV sedation was given by Anesthesia Department. The Olympus videoscope was inserted into anus. Using air insufflation, the colonoscope was advanced through the anus to the rectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon and cecum, the above gross findings were noted. The colonoscope was slowly withdrawn and carefully examined the lumen of the bowel. When the polyp again was visualized, the snare was passed around the polyp. It required at least two to three passes of the snare to remove the polyp in its totality. There was a large stalk on the polyp. ________ the polyp had been removed down to the junction of the polyp in the stalk, which appeared to be cauterized and no residual adenomatous tissue was present. No bleeding was identified. The colonoscope was then removed and patient was sent to recovery room in stable condition."
44,Gastroenterology,"INDICATION: Iron deficiency anemia.PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy with terminal ileum examination.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Normal examination.WITHDRAWAL TIME: 15 minutes.SCOPE: CF-H180AL.MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl 100 mcg and versed 10 mg.PROCEDURE DETAIL: Following the preprocedure patient assessment the procedure, goals, risks including bleeding, perforation, missed polyp rate as well as side effects of medications and alternatives were reviewed. Questions were answered. Pause preprocedure was performed.Following titrated intravenous sedation the flexible video endoscope was introduced into the rectum and advanced to the cecum without difficulty. The ileocecal valve looked normal. Preparation was fair allowing examination of 85% of mucosa after washing and cleaning with tap water through the scope. The terminal ileum was intubated through the ileocecal valve for a 5 cm extent. Terminal ileum mucosa looked normal.Then the scope was withdrawn while examining the mucosa carefully including the retroflexed views of the rectum. No polyp, no diverticulum and no bleeding source was identified.The patient was assessed upon completion of the procedure. Okay to discharge once criteria met. RECOMMENDATIONS: Follow up with primary care physician."
45,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Prior history of anemia, abdominal bloating.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: External hemorrhoids, otherwise unremarkable colonoscopy.PREMEDICATIONS: Versed 5 mg, Demerol 50 mg IV.REPORT OF PROCEDURE: Digital rectal exam revealed external hemorrhoids. The colonoscope was inserted into the rectal ampulla and advanced to the cecum. The position of the scope within the cecum was verified by identification of the appendiceal orifice. The cecum, the ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, descending colon, and rectum were normal. The scope was retroflexed in the rectum and no abnormality was seen. So the scope was straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated.ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION:1. Normal colonoscopy.2. External hemorrhoids."
46,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Screening. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tiny Polyps.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy.PROCEDURE: The procedure, indications, and risks were explained to the patient, who understood and agreed. He was sedated with Versed 3 mg, Demerol 25 mg during the examination. A digital rectal exam was performed and the Pentax Video Colonoscope was advanced over the examiner's finger into the rectum. It was passed to the level of the cecum. The ileocecal valve was identified, as was the appendiceal orifice. Slowly withdrawal through the colon revealed a small polyp in the transverse colon. This was approximately 3 mm in size and was completely removed using multiple bites with cold biopsy forceps. In addition, there was a 2 mm polyp versus lymphoid aggregate in the descending colon. This was also removed using the cold biopsy forceps. Further detail failed to reveal any other lesions with the exception of small hemorrhoids. IMPRESSION: Tiny polyps. PLAN: If adenomatous, repeat exam in five years. Otherwise, repeat exam in 10 years."
47,Gastroenterology,"OPERATIVE PROCEDURES: Colonoscopy and biopsies, epinephrine sclerotherapy, hot biopsy cautery, and snare polypectomy.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Colon cancer screening.2. Family history of colon polyps.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Multiple colon polyps (5).2. Diverticulosis, sigmoid colon.3. Internal hemorrhoids.ENDOSCOPE USED: EC3870LK.BIOPSIES: Biopsies taken from all polyps. Hot biopsy got applied to one. Epinephrine sclerotherapy and snare polypectomy applied to four polyps.ANESTHESIA: Fentanyl 75 mcg, Versed 6 mg, and glucagon 1.5 units IV push in divided doses. Also given epinephrine 1:20,000 total of 3 mL.The patient tolerated the procedure well.PROCEDURE: The patient was placed in left lateral decubitus after appropriate sedation. Digital rectal examination was done, which was normal. Endoscope was introduced and passed through a rather spastic tortuous sigmoid colon with multiple diverticula seen all the way through transverse colon where about 1 cm x 1 cm sessile polyp was seen. It was biopsied and then in piecemeal fashion removed using snare polypectomy after base was infiltrated with epinephrine. Pedunculated polyp next to it was hard to see and there was a lot of peristalsis. The scope then was advanced through rest of the transverse colon to ascending colon and cecum. Terminal ileum was briefly reviewed, appeared normal and so did cecum after copious amount of fecal material was irrigated out. Ascending colon was unremarkable. At hepatic flexure may be proximal transverse colon, there was a sessile polyp about 1.2 cm x 1 cm that was removed in the same manner with a biopsy taken, base infiltrated with epinephrine and at least two passes of snare polypectomy and subsequent hot biopsy cautery removed to hold polypoid tissue, which could be seen. In transverse colon on withdrawal and relaxation with epinephrine, an additional 1 mm to 2 mm sessile polyp was removed by hot biopsy. Then in the transverse colon, additional larger polyp about 1.3 cm x 1.2 cm was removed in piecemeal fashion again with epinephrine, sclerotherapy, and snare polypectomy. Subsequently pedunculated polyp in distal transverse colon near splenic flexure was removed with snare polypectomy. The rest of the splenic flexure and descending colon were unremarkable. Diverticulosis was again seen with almost constant spasm despite of glucagon. Sigmoid colon did somewhat hinder the inspection of that area. Rectum, retroflexion posterior anal canal showed internal hemorrhoids moderate to large. Excess of air insufflated was removed. The endoscope was withdrawn.PLAN: Await biopsy report. Pending biopsy report, recommendation will be made when the next colonoscopy should be done at least three years perhaps sooner besides and due to multitude of the patient's polyps."
48,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: The patient is a 56-year-old female. She was referred for a screening colonoscopy. The patient has bowel movements every other day. There is no blood in the stool, no abdominal pain. She has hypertension, dyslipidemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She has had cesarean section twice in the past. Physical examination is unremarkable. There is no family history of colon cancer.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diverticulosis.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Procedure and possible complications were explained to the patient. Ample opportunity was provided to her to ask questions. Informed consent was obtained. She was placed in left lateral position. Inspection of perianal area was normal. Digital exam of the rectum was normal.Video Olympus colonoscope was introduced into the rectum. The sigmoid colon is very tortuous. The instrument was advanced to the cecum after placing the patient in a supine position. The patient was well prepared and a good examination was possible. The cecum was identified by the ileocecal valve and the appendiceal orifice. Images were taken. The instrument was then gradually withdrawn while examining the colon again in a circumferential manner. Few diverticula were encountered in the sigmoid and descending colon. Retroflex view of the rectum was unremarkable. No polyps or malignancy was identified.After obtaining images, the air was suctioned. Instrument was withdrawn from the patient. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Colonoscopy was performed to cecum and demonstrates the following:1. Mild-to-moderate diverticulosis.2. RECOMMENDATION:1. The patient was provided information on diverticulosis including dietary advice.2. She was advised repeat colonoscopy after 10 years."
49,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prior history of neoplastic polyps.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Small rectal polyps/removed and fulgurated.PREMEDICATIONS: Prior to the colonoscopy, the patient complained of a sever headache and she was concerned that she might become ill. I asked the nurse to give her 25 mg of Demerol IV.Following the IV Demerol, she had a nausea reaction. She was then given 25 mg of Phenergan IV. Following this, her headache and nausea completely resolved. She was then given a total of 7.5 mg of Versed with adequate sedation. Rectal exam revealed no external lesions. Digital exam revealed no mass.REPORTED PROCEDURE: The P160 colonoscope was used. The scope was placed in the rectal ampulla and advanced to the cecum. Navigation through the sigmoid colon was difficult. Beginning at 30 cm was a very tight bend. With gentle maneuvering, the scope passed through and then entered the cecum. The cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, and descending colon were normal. The sigmoid colon was likewise normal. There were five very small (punctate) polyps in the rectum. One was resected using the electrocautery snare and the other four were ablated using the snare and cautery. There was no specimen because the polyps were so small. The scope was retroflexed in the rectum and no further abnormality was seen, so the scope was straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated.ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION:1. Five small polyps as described, all fulgurated.2. Otherwise unremarkable colonoscopy."
50,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diarrhea, suspected irritable bowel.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Normal colonoscopy. PREMEDICATIONS: Versed 5 mg, Demerol 75 mg IV.REPORTED PROCEDURE: The rectal exam revealed no external lesions. The prostate was normal in size and consistency.The colonoscope was inserted into the cecum with ease. The cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum were normal. The scope was retroflexed in the rectum and no abnormality was seen, so the scope was straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated.ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION: Normal colonoscopy - no evidence of inflammatory disease, polyp, or other neoplasm. These findings are certainly consistent with irritable bowel syndrome."
51,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy.INDICATIONS: Hematochezia, Personal history of colonic polyps.MEDICATIONS: Midazolam 2 mg IV, Fentanyl 100 mcg IVPROCEDURE: A History and Physical has been performed, and patient medication allergies have been reviewed. The patient's tolerance of previous anesthesia has been reviewed. The risks and benefits of the procedure and the sedation options and risks were discussed with the patient.

Respiratory Examination: clear to auscultation. CV Examination: RRR, no murmurs, no S3 or S4. ASA Grade Assessment: P1 A normal healthy patient. After reviewing the risks and benefits, the patient was deemed in satisfactory condition to undergo the procedure. The anesthesia plan was to use conscious sedation. Immediately prior to administration of medications, the patient was re-assessed for adequacy to receive sedatives. The heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, blood pressure, adequacy of pulmonary ventilation, and response to care were monitored throughout the procedure. The physical status of the patient was re-assessed after the procedure. After I obtained informed consent, the scope was passed under direct vision. Throughout the procedure, the patient's blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen saturations were monitored continuously. The colonoscope was introduced through the anus and advanced to the cecum, identified by appendiceal orifice & IC valve. The quality of the prep was good. The patient tolerated the procedure well.FINDINGS:1. A sessile, non-bleeding polyp was found in the rectum. The polyp was 5 mm in size. Polypectomy was performed with a saline injection-lift technique using the snare. Resection and retrieval were complete. Estimated blood loss was minimal.2.

There is no family history of colon cancer and there has been no blood in the stool.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy.PREP: Fentanyl 100 mcg IV and 3 mg Versed IV.PROCEDURE: The tip of the endoscope was introduced into the rectum. Retroflexion of the tip of the endoscope failed to reveal any distal rectal lesions. The rest of the colon through to the cecum was well visualized. The cecal strap, ileocecal valve, and light reflex in the right lower quadrant were all identified. There was no evidence of tumor, polyp, mass, ulceration, or other focus of inflammation. Adverse reactions none.IMPRESSION: Normal colonic mucosa through to the cecum. There was no evidence of tumor or polyp."
53,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Follow up adenomas.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Two colon polyps, removed.2. Small internal hemorrhoids.3. Otherwise normal examination of cecum.MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl 150 mcg and Versed 7 mg slow IV push.INDICATIONS: This is a 60-year-old white female with a history of adenomas. She does have irregular bowel habits.FINDINGS: The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and the above medications were administered. The colonoscope was advanced to the cecum as identified by the ileocecal valve, appendiceal orifice, and blind pouch. The colonoscope was slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the colonic mucosa was made, including a retroflexed view of the rectum. There was a 4 mm descending colon polyp, which was removed with jumbo forceps, and sent for histology in bottle one. There was a 10 mm pale, flat polyp in the distal rectum, which was removed with jumbo forceps, and sent for histology in bottle 2. There were small internal hemorrhoids. The remainder of the examination was normal to the cecum. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.IMPRESSION:1. Two colon polyps, removed.2. Small internal hemorrhoids.3. Otherwise normal examination to cecum.PLAN: I will await the results of the colon polyp histology. The patient was told the importance of daily fiber."
54,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Colonoscopy.INDICATIONS: Renewed symptoms likely consistent with active flare of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, not responsive to conventional therapy including sulfasalazine, cortisone, local therapy.PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure with special attention to benefits, risks, alternatives. Risks explained as bleeding, infection, bowel perforation, aspiration pneumonia, or reaction to the medications. Vital signs were monitored by blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. Supplemental O2 given. Specifics discussed. Preprocedure physical exam performed. Stable vital signs. Lungs clear. Cardiac exam showed regular rhythm. Abdomen soft. Her past history, her past workup, her past visitation with me for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, well responsive to sulfasalazine reviewed. She currently has a flare and is not responding, therefore, likely may require steroid taper. At the same token, her symptoms are mild. She has rectal bleeding, essentially only some rusty stools. There is not significant diarrhea, just some lower stools. No significant pain. Therefore, it is possible that we are just dealing with a hemorrhoidal bleed, therefore, colonoscopy now needed. Past history reviewed. Specifics of workup, need for followup, and similar discussed. All questions answered.A normal digital rectal examination was performed. The PCF-160 AL was inserted into the anus and advanced to the cecum without difficulty, as identified by the ileocecal valve, cecal stump, and appendical orifice. All mucosal aspects thoroughly inspected, including a retroflexed examination. Withdrawal time was greater than six minutes. Unfortunately, the terminal ileum could not be intubated despite multiple attempts.Findings were those of a normal cecum, right colon, transverse colon, descending colon. A small cecal polyp was noted, this was biopsy-removed, placed in bottle #1. Random biopsies from the cecum obtained, bottle #2; random biopsies from the transverse colon obtained, as well as descending colon obtained, bottle #3. There was an area of inflammation in the proximal sigmoid colon, which was biopsied, placed in bottle #4. There was an area of relative sparing, with normal sigmoid lining, placed in bottle #5, randomly biopsied, and then inflammation again in the distal sigmoid colon and rectum biopsied, bottle #6, suggesting that we may be dealing with Crohn disease, given the relative sparing of the sigmoid colon and junk lesion. Retroflexed showed hemorrhoidal disease. Scope was then withdrawn, patient left in good condition. IMPRESSION: Active flare of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, question of Crohn disease.PLAN: I will have the patient follow up with me, will follow up on histology, follow up on the polyps. She will be put on a steroid taper and make an appointment and hopefully steroids alone will do the job. If not, she may be started on immune suppressive medication, such as azathioprine, or similar. All of this has been reviewed with the patient. All questions answered."
55,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prior history of polyps.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Small polyps, no evidence of residual or recurrent polyp in the cecum.PREMEDICATIONS: Versed 5 mg, Demerol 100 mg IV.REPORTED PROCEDURE: The rectal chamber revealed no external lesions. Prostate was normal in size and consistency.The colonoscope was inserted into the rectal ampulla and advanced under direct vision at all times until the tip of the scope was placed in the cecum. The position of the scope within the cecum was verified by identification of the ileocecal valve. Navigation was difficult because it seemed that the cecum took an upward turn at its final turn, but the examination was completed.The cecum was extensively studied and no lesion was seen. There was not even a scar representing the prior polyp. I was able to see the area across from the ileocecal valve exactly where the polyp was two years ago, and I saw no lesion at all. The scope was then slowly withdrawn. In the mid transverse colon, was a small submucosal lesion, which appeared to be a lipoma. It was freely mobile and very small with normal overlying mucosa. There was a similar lesion in the descending colon. Both of these appeared to be lipomatous, so no attempt was made to remove them. There were diverticula present in the sigmoid colon. In addition, there were two polyps in the sigmoid colon both of which were resected using electrocautery. There was no bleeding. The scope was then withdrawn. The rectum was normal. When the scope was retroflexed in the rectum, two very small polyps were noted just at the anorectal margin, and so these were obliterated using the electrocautery snare. There was no specimen and there was no bleeding. The scope was then straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated.ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION:1. Small polyps, sigmoid colon, resected them.2. Diverticulosis, sigmoid colon.3. Small rectal polyps, obliterated them.4. Submucosal lesions, consistent with lipomata as described.5. No evidence of residual or recurrent neoplasm in the cecum."
56,Gastroenterology,"(Medical Transcription Sample Report)PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Hematochezia.2. Refractory dyspepsia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Colonic polyps at 35 cm and 15 cm.2. Diverticulosis coli.2. Acute and chronic gastritis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:1. Colonoscopy to cecum with snare polypectomy.2. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURES: This is a 43-year-old white male who presents as an outpatient to the General Surgery Service with hematochezia with no explainable source at the anal verge. He also had refractory dyspepsia despite b.i.d., Nexium therapy. The patient does use alcohol and tobacco. The patient gave informed consent for the procedure.GROSS FINDINGS: At the time of colonoscopy, the entire length of colon was visualized. The patient was found to have a sigmoid diverticulosis. He also was found to have some colonic polyps at 35 cm and 15 cm. The polyps were large enough to be treated with snare cautery technique. The polyps were achieved and submitted to pathology. EGD did confirm acute and chronic gastritis. The biopsies were performed for H&E and CLO testing. The patient had no evidence of distal esophagitis or ulcers. No mass lesions were seen.PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the Endoscopy Suite with the heart and lungs examination unremarkable. The vital signs were monitored and found to be stable throughout the procedure. The patient was placed in the left lateral position where intravenous Demerol and Versed were given in a titrated fashion.The video Olympus colonoscope was advanced per anus and without difficulty to the level of cecum. Photographic documentation of the diverticulosis and polyps were obtained. The patient's polyps were removed in a similar fashion, each removed with snare cautery. The polyps were encircled at their stalk. Increasing the tension and cautery was applied as coagulation and cutting blunt mode, 15/15 was utilized. Good blanching was seen. The polyp was retrieved with the suction port of the scope. The patient was re-scoped to the polyp levels to confirm that there was no evidence of perforation or bleeding at the polypectomy site. Diverticulosis coli was also noted. With colonoscopy completed, the patient was then turned for EGD. The oropharynx was previously anesthetized with Cetacaine spray and a biteblock was placed. Video Olympus GIF gastroscope model was inserted per os and advanced without difficulty through the hypopharynx. The esophagus revealed a GE junction at 39 cm. The GE junction was grossly within normal limits. The stomach was entered and distended with air. Acute and chronic gastritis features as stated were appreciated. The pylorus was traversed with normal duodenum. The stomach was again reentered. Retroflex maneuver of the scope confirmed that there was no evidence of hiatal hernia. There were no ulcers or mass lesions seen. The patient had biopsy performed of the antrum for H&E and CLO testing. There was no evidence of untoward bleeding at biopsy sites. Insufflated air was removed with withdrawal of the scope. The patient will be placed on a reflux diet, given instruction and information on Nexium usage. Additional recommendations will follow pending biopsy results. He is to also abstain from alcohol and tobacco. He will require follow-up colonoscopy again in three years for polyp disease."
57,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: History of colitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Small left colon polyp.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Total colonoscopy and polypectomy.ANESTHESIA: IV Versed 8 mg and 175 mcg of IV fentanyl.CLINICAL HISTORY: This patient had a tough time with colitis 10 years ago and has intermittent problems with bleeding. He has been admitted to the hospital now for colonoscopy and polyp surveillance.PROCEDURE: The patient was prepped and draped in a left lateral decubitus position. The flexible 165 cm CF video Olympus colonoscope was inserted through the anus and passed under TV-directed monitor through the area of the rectum, sigmoid colon, left colon, transverse colon, right colon, and cecum. He had an excellent prep. He had a 2-3 mm polyp in the left colon that was removed with a jumbo biopsy forceps. He tolerated the procedure well. There was no other evidence of any cancer, growth, tumor, colitis, or problems throughout the entire colon. His exam that he had in 1997 showed a small amount of colitis at that time and he has had some intermittent symptoms since. Representative pictures were taken throughout the entire exam. There was no other evidence any problems. On withdrawal of the scope, the same findings were noted.FINAL IMPRESSION: Small, left colon polyp in a patient with intermittent colitis-like symptoms and bleeding."
58,Gastroenterology,"PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Colon cancer screening.POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Colon polyps, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy, conscious sedation, and snare polypectomy. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 63-year-old male who has myelodysplastic syndrome, who was referred for colonoscopy. He has had previous colonoscopy. There is no family history of bleeding, no current problems with his bowels. On examination, he has internal hemorrhoids. His prostate is enlarged and increased somewhat in firmness. He has scattered diverticular disease of a moderate degree and he has two polyps, one 1 cm in the mid ascending colon, and one in the left transverse colon, which is also 1 cm. These were removed with snare polypectomy technique. I would recommend that the patient have an increased fiber diet and repeat colonoscopy in 5 years or sooner if he develops bowel habit change or bleeding.PROCEDURE: After explaining the operative procedure, the risks and potential complications of bleeding and perforation, the patient was given 175 mcg fentanyl, and 8 mg Versed intravenously for conscious sedation. Blood pressure 115/60, pulse 98, respiration 18, and saturation 92%. A rectal examination was done and then the colonoscope was inserted through the anorectum, rectosigmoid, descending, transverse, and ascending colon, to the ileocecal valve. The scope was withdrawn to the mid ascending colon, where the polyp was encircled with a snare and removed with a mixture of cutting and coagulating current, then retrieved through the suction port. The scope was withdrawn into the left transverse colon, where the second polyp was identified. It was encircled with a snare and removed with a mixture of cutting and coagulating current, and then removed through the suction port as well. The scope was then gradually withdrawn the remaining distance and removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
59,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Alternating hard and soft stools.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:Sigmoid diverticulosis.Sessile polyp of the sigmoid colon.Pedunculated polyp of the sigmoid colon.PROCEDURE: Total colonoscopy with biopsy and snare polypectomy.PREP: 4/4.DIFFICULTY: 1/4.PREMEDICATION AND SEDATION: Fentanyl 100, midazolam 5.INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: A 64-year-old male who has developed alternating hard and soft stools. He has one bowel movement a day.FINDINGS: There is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of inflammation or bleeding. There was a small, sessile polyp in the sigmoid colon, and a larger pedunculated polyp in the sigmoid colon, both appeared adenomatous.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Preoperative counseling, including an explicit discussion of the risk and treatment of perforation was provided. Preoperative physical examination was performed. Informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Premedications were given slowly by intravenous push. Rectal examination was performed, which was normal. The scope was introduced and passed with minimal difficulty to the cecum. This was verified anatomically and video photographs were taken of the ileocecal valve and appendiceal orifice. The scope was slowly withdrawn, the mucosa carefully visualized. It was normal in its entirety until reaching the sigmoid colon. Sigmoid colon had extensive diverticular disease, small-mouth, without inflammation or bleeding. In addition, there was a small sessile polyp, which was cold biopsied and recovered, and approximately an 8 mm pedunculated polyp. A snare was placed on the stalk of the polyp and divided with electrocautery. The polyp was recovered and sent for pathologic examination. Examination of the stalk showed good hemostasis. The scope was slowly withdrawn and the remainder of the examination was normal.ASSESSMENT: Diverticular disease. A diverticular disease handout was given to the patient's wife and a high fiber diet was recommended. In addition, 2 polyps, one of which is assuredly an adenoma. Patient needs a repeat colonoscopy in 3 years."
60,Gastroenterology,"The patient was placed in left lateral decubitus position and the above medications were administered. The colonoscope was advanced to the cecum, as identified by the ileocecal valve, appendiceal orifice, and blind pouch. The colonoscope was slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the colonic mucosa was made, including a retroflexed view of the rectum. The remainder of the examination was normal to the cecum. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication."
61,Gastroenterology,"The tip of the endoscope was inserted in the rectum. Retroflexion of the tip of the endoscope failed to reveal any distal rectal lesions. The rest of the colon, through to the cecum, was well visualized. The cecal strap and ileocecal valve were both identified. There was no evidence of tumor, polyp, mass, ulceration, or other focus of inflammation. Adverse reactions none."
62,Gastroenterology,"The patient was brought to the endoscopy suite, where they were placed in left lateral Sims position and underwent IV sedation. Digital rectal examination was performed, which showed no masses. The colonoscope was placed in the rectum and advanced under direct vision to the cecum. The remainder of the colonoscopy was normal. On withdrawal of the scope, there was no evidence of any mass, lesions, mucosal abnormalities, friability, or polyps. The patient was then awakened and taken from the endoscopy suite in stable condition."
63,Gastroenterology,"Informed consent was obtained from the patient after the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained. The risks that were explained were bleeding, infection, perforation, and allergic reaction to the medications, as well as the possibility of missing small polyps within the colon. Conscious sedation was achieved with the patient lying in the left lateral decubitus position.A colonoscope was then passed through the rectum, all the way toward the cecum, which was identified by the presence of the appendiceal orifice and ileocecal valve. This was done without difficulty and the bowel preparation was good. The ileocecal valve was intubated and the distal 2 to 3 cm of terminal ileum was inspected and was normal. The colonoscope was then slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the mucosa was performed.COMPLICATIONS: None."
64,Gastroenterology,"The patient was identified. Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient. The patient understood, was consented, brought in the procedure room, and connected to the appropriate monitoring devices. Versed and fentanyl were given in divided doses. After appropriate sedation was achieved, a digital rectal examination was done and was normal. A well-lubricated colonoscope was then inserted and advanced under direct visualization to the level of the cecum. A picture was taken at the level of the cecum and the colonoscope was then slowly withdrawn. After the procedure was done, the colonoscope was removed, and the patient was returned to the recovery room in stable condition. There were no complications."
65,Gastroenterology,"INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: A 79-year-old Filipino woman referred for colonoscopy secondary to heme-positive stools. Procedure done to rule out generalized diverticular change, colitis, and neoplasia.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was explained the procedure in detail, possible complications including infection, perforation, adverse reaction of medication, and bleeding. Informed consent was signed by the patient.With the patient in left decubitus position, had received a cumulative dose of 4 mg of Versed and 75 mg of Demerol, using Olympus video colonoscope under direct visualization was advanced to the cecum. Photodocumentation of appendiceal orifice and the ileocecal valve obtained. Cecum was slightly obscured with stool but the colon itself was adequately prepped. There was no evidence of overt colitis, telangiectasia, or overt neoplasia. There was moderately severe diverticular change, which was present throughout the colon and photodocumented. The rectal mucosa was normal and retroflexed with mild internal hemorrhoids. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.IMPRESSION:1. Colonoscopy to the cecum with adequate preparation.2. Long tortuous spastic colon.3. Moderately severe diverticular changes present throughout.4. Mild internal hemorrhoids.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Clear liquid diet today.2. Follow up with primary care physician as scheduled from time to time.3. Increase fiber in diet, strongly consider fiber supplementation."
66,Gastroenterology,"PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Change in bowel function.POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Proctosigmoiditis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy with biopsy.ANESTHESIA: IV sedation.POSTPROCEDURE CONDITION: Stable. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 33-year-old with a recent change in bowel function and hematochezia. He is here for colonoscopy. He understands the risks and wishes to proceed. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the endoscopy suite where he was placed in left lateral Sims position, underwent IV sedation. Digital rectal examination was performed, which showed no masses, and a boggy prostate. The colonoscope was placed in the rectum and advanced, under direct vision, to the cecum. In the rectum and sigmoid, there were ulcerations, edema, mucosal abnormalities, and loss of vascular pattern consistent with proctosigmoiditis. Multiple random biopsies were taken of the left and right colon to see if this was in fact pan colitis.RECOMMENDATIONS: Follow up with me in 2 weeks and we will begin Canasa suppositories."
67,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy and biopsy.INDICATIONS: The patient is a 50-year-old female who has had a history of a nonspecific colitis, who was admitted 3 months ago at Hospital because of severe right-sided abdominal pains, was found to have multiple ulcers within the right colon, and was then readmitted approximately 2 weeks later because of a cecal volvulus, and had a right hemicolectomy. Since then, she has had persistent right abdominal pains, as well as diarrhea, with up to 2-4 bowel movements per day. She has had problems with recurrent seizures and has been seen by Dr. XYZ, who started her recently on methadone.MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl 200 mcg, Versed 10 mg, Phenergan 25 mg intravenously given throughout the procedure.INSTRUMENT: PCF-160L.PROCEDURE REPORT: Informed consent was obtained from the patient, after the risks and benefits of the procedure were carefully explained, which included but were not limited to bleeding, infection, perforation, and allergic reaction to the medications, as well as the possibility of missing polyps within the colon.A colonoscope was then passed through the rectum, all the way toward the ileal colonic anastomosis, seen within the proximal transverse colon. The distal ileum was examined, which was normal in appearance. Random biopsies were obtained from the ileum and placed in jar #1. Random biopsies were obtained from the normal-appearing colon and placed in jar #2. Small internal hemorrhoids were noted within the rectum on retroflexion.COMPLICATIONS: None.ASSESSMENT:1. Small internal hemorrhoids.2. Ileal colonic anastomosis seen in the proximal transverse colon.3. Otherwise normal colonoscopy and ileum examination.PLAN: Followup results of biopsies. If the biopsies are unremarkable, the patient may benefit from a trial of tricyclic antidepressants, if it's okay with Dr. XYZ, for treatment of her chronic abdominal pains."
68,Gastroenterology,"PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever.POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Pending pathology.PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Colonoscopy with multiple biopsies, including terminal ileum, cecum, hepatic flexure, and sigmoid colon. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 28-year-old female with history of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever. Colonoscopy is indicated to evaluate for etiology.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the endoscopy suite with IV fluids being administered. She was given a total of 300 mcg of fentanyl and 15 mg of Versed, titrated for conscious IV sedation. Her heart rate, heart rhythm, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored throughout the procedure. She remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. The procedure began with a digital rectal examination. The scope was then placed through the anus and advanced without difficulty to the terminal ileum. There was what appeared to be some inflammation of the terminal ileum. This was biopsied. The scope was then withdrawn into the cecum, where biopsies were obtained. The scope was then slowly withdrawn throughout the entire length of the colon. The prep was adequate, but multiple syringes of irrigation were necessary to irrigate out some of the residual stool and allow for better visualization of the colonic mucosa. There was an area of induration and inflammation at the hepatic flexure. This was biopsied. The scope was again withdrawn throughout the length of the colon. There was also some area of inflammation in the sigmoid colon with narrowing. Again, these findings were seen on the way in with the colonoscope and were not due to scope trauma or the procedure itself. Further biopsies were obtained of the sigmoid colon in this area of narrowing. Total biopsies included terminal ileum, cecum, hepatic flexure, and sigmoid colon. The scope was then withdrawn into the rectum. Retroflexion showed a normal-appearing anal canal with no internal hemorrhoids or fissures. Other than the areas of inflammation, there were no other abnormalities identified, no AV malformations, no polyps, no diverticulum. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate postprocedure complications."
69,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea. OPERATION PERFORMED: Colonoscopy with random biopsies and culture.INDICATIONS: The patient is a 50-year-old woman who underwent hemorrhoidectomy approximately one year ago. She has been having difficulty since that time with intermittent diarrhea and abdominal pain. She states this happens quite frequently and can even happen when she uses topical prednisone for her ears or for her eyes. She presents today for screening colonoscopy, based on the same.OPERATIVE COURSE: The risks and benefits of colonoscopy were explained to the patient in detail. She provided her consent. The morning of the operation, the patient was transported from the preoperative holding area to the endoscopy suite. She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. In divided doses, she was given 7 mg of Versed and 125 mcg of fentanyl. A digital rectal examination was performed, after which time the scope was intubated from the anus to the level of the hepatic flexure. This was intubated fairly easily; however, the patient was clearly in some discomfort and was shouting out, despite the amount of anesthesia she was provided. In truth, the pain she was experiencing was out of proportion to any maneuver or difficulty with the procedure. While more medication could have been given, the patient is actually a fairly thin woman and diminutive and I was concerned that giving her any more sedation may lead to respiratory or cardiovascular collapse. In addition, she was really having quite some difficulty staying still throughout the procedure and was putting us all at some risk. For this reason, the procedure was aborted at the level of the hepatic flexure. She was noted to have some pools of stool. This was suctioned and sent to pathology for C difficile, ova and parasites, and fecal leukocytes. Additionally, random biopsies were performed of the colon itself. It is unfortunate we were unable to complete this procedure, as I would have liked to have taken biopsies of the terminal ileum. However, given the degree of discomfort she had, again, coupled with the relative ease of the procedure itself, I am very suspicious of irritable bowel syndrome. The patient tolerated the remainder of the procedure fairly well and was sent to the recovery room in stable condition, where it is anticipated she will be discharged to home.PLAN: She needs to follow up with me in approximately 2 weeks' time, both to follow up with her biopsies and cultures. She has been given a prescription for VSL3, a probiotic, to assist with reculturing the rectum. She may also benefit from an antispasmodic and/or anxiolytic. Lastly, it should be noted that when she next undergoes endoscopic procedure, propofol would be indicated."
70,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Blood loss anemia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Diverticulosis coli.2. Internal hemorrhoids.3. Poor prep.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy with photos.ANESTHESIA: Conscious sedation per Anesthesia.SPECIMENS: None.HISTORY: The patient is an 85-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with a markedly decreased hemoglobin and blood loss anemia. She underwent an EGD and attempted colonoscopy; however, due to a very poor prep, only a flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed at that time. A coloscopy is now being performed for completion.PROCEDURE: After proper informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the Endoscopy Suite. She was placed in the left lateral position and was given sedation by the Anesthesia Department. A digital rectal exam was performed and there was no evidence of mass. The colonoscope was then inserted into the rectum. There was some solid stool encountered. The scope was maneuvered around this. There was relatively poor prep as the scope was advanced through the sigmoid colon and portions of the descending colon. The scope was then passed through the transverse colon and ascending colon to the cecum. No masses or polyps were noted. Visualization of the portions of the colon was however somewhat limited. There were scattered diverticuli noted in the sigmoid.The scope was slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls. Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed and nonsurgical internal hemorrhoids were noted. The scope was then completely withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition. She will be placed on a high-fiber diet and Colace and we will continue to monitor her hemoglobin."
71,Gastroenterology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Colostomy failure. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient had a colostomy placed 9 days ago after resection of colonic carcinoma. Earlier today, he felt nauseated and stated that his colostomy stopped filling. He also had a sensation of ""heartburn."" He denies vomiting but has been nauseated. He denies diarrhea. He denies hematochezia, hematemesis, or melena. He denies frank abdominal pain or fever. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above. Also, hypertension. ALLERGIES: ""Fleet enema."" MEDICATIONS: Accupril and vitamins. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:SYSTEMIC: The patient denies fever or chills.HEENT: The patient denies blurred vision, headache, or change in hearing.NECK: The patient denies dysphagia, dysphonia, or neck pain.RESPIRATORY: The patient denies shortness of breath, cough, or hemoptysis.CARDIAC: The patient denies history of arrhythmia, swelling of the extremities, palpitations, or chest pain.GASTROINTESTINAL: See above.MUSCULOSKELETAL: The patient denies arthritis, arthralgias, or joint swelling.NEUROLOGIC: The patient denies difficulty with balance, numbness, or paralysis.GENITOURINARY: The patient denies dysuria, flank pain, or hematuria.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 183/108, pulse 76, respirations 16, temperature 98.7. HEENT: Cranial nerves are grossly intact. There is no scleral icterus. NECK: No jugular venous distention. CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended. Bowel sounds are decreased and high-pitched. There is a large midline laparotomy scar with staples still in place. There is no evidence of wound infection. Examination of the colostomy port reveals no obvious fecal impaction or site of obstruction. There is no evidence of infection. The mucosa appears normal. There is a small amount of nonbloody stool in the colostomy bag. There are no masses or bruits noted. EXTREMITIES: There is no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. Pulses are 2+ and equal bilaterally. NEUROLOGIC: The patient is alert and awake with no focal motor or sensory deficit noted. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING: Failure of colostomy to function may repre- sent an impaction; however, I did not appreciate this on physical examination. There may also be an adhesion or proximal impaction which I cannot reach, which may cause a bowel obstruction, failure of the shunt, nausea, and ultimately vomiting. An abdominal series was obtained, which confirmed this possibility by demonstrating air-fluid levels and dilated bowel. The CBC showed WBC of 9.4 with normal differential. Hematocrit is 42.6. I interpret this as normal. Amylase is currently pending. I have discussed this case with Dr. S, the patient's surgeon, who agrees that there is a possibility of bowel obstruction and the patient should be admitted to observation. Because of the patient's insurance status, the patient will actually be admitted to Dr. D on observation. I have discussed the case with Dr. P, who is the doctor on call for Dr. D. Both Dr. S and Dr. P have been informed of the patient's condition and are aware of his situation. FINAL IMPRESSION: Bowel obstruction, status post colostomy. DISPOSITION: Admission to observation. The patient's condition is good. He is hemodynamically stable."

Father is alive, but unknown medical history as they have been estranged. She has a 51-year-old sister with history of multiple colon polyps. She has 2 brothers, 1 of whom has schizophrenia, but she knows very little about their medical history. To the best of her knowledge, there are no family members with stomach cancer or colon cancer.SOCIAL HISTORY: She was born in Houston, Texas and moved to Florida about 3 years ago. She is divorced. She has worked as a travel agent. She has 2 sons ages 24 and 26, both of whom are alive and well. She smokes a half a pack of cigarettes per day for more than 35 years.

Otherwise, review of systems is negative for strokes, paralysis, gout, cataracts, glaucoma, respiratory difficulties, tuberculosis, chest pain, heart disease, kidney stones, hematuria, rheumatic fever, scarlet fever, cancer, diabetes, thyroid disease, seizure disorder, blood transfusions, anemia, jaundice, or pruritus.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Weight 152 pounds. Height is 5 feet 3 inches. Blood pressure 136/80. Pulse 68. In general: She is a well-developed and well-nourished female who ambulates with the assistance of a cane. Neurologically nonfocal. Awake, alert, and oriented x 3. HEENT: Head normocephalic, atraumatic. Sclerae anicteric. Conjunctivae are pink. Mouth is moist without any obvious oral lesions. Neck is supple. There is no submandibular, submaxillary, axillary, supraclavicular, or epitrochlear adenopathy appreciable. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm without obvious gallops or murmurs. Abdomen is soft, nontender with good bowel sounds. No organomegaly or masses are appreciable. Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis, and/or edema. Skin is warm and dry. Rectal was deferred and will be done at the time of the colonoscopy.IMPRESSION:1. A 50-year-old female whose 51-year-old sister has a history of multiple colon polyps, which may slightly increase her risk for colon cancer in the future.2. Reports of recurrent bright red blood per rectum, mostly on the toilet paper over the past year. Bleeding most likely consistent with internal hemorrhoids; however, she needs further evaluation for colon polyps or colon cancer.3. Alternations between constipation and diarrhea for the past several years with some lower abdominal cramping and discomfort particularly associated with constipation. She is on multiple medications including narcotics and may have developed narcotic bowel syndrome.4. A long history of pyrosis, dyspepsia, nausea, and belching for many years relieved by antacids. She may likely have underlying gastroesophageal reflux disease.5. A 1-year history of some early satiety and fluctuations in her weight up and down 4 pounds. She may also have some GI dysmotility including gastroparesis.6. Report of dysphagia to solids over the past several years with a history of a bone spur in her cervical spine. If this bone spur is pressing anteriorly, it could certainly cause recurrent symptoms of dysphagia. Differential also includes peptic stricture or Schatzki's ring, and even remotely, the possibility of an esophageal malignancy.7. A history of infectious hepatitis in the past with some recent mild elevations in AST and ALT levels without clear etiology. She may have some reaction to her multiple medications including her statin drugs, which can cause mild elevations in transaminases. She may have some underlying fatty liver disease and differential could include some form of viral hepatitis such as hepatitis B or even C.PLAN:1. We have asked her to follow up with her primary care physician with regard to this recent elevation in her transaminases. She will likely have the lab tests repeated in the future, and if they remain persistently elevated, we will be happy to see her in the future for further evaluation if her primary care physician would like.2. Discussed reflux precautions and gave literature for further review.3. Schedule an upper endoscopy with possible esophageal dilatation, as well as colonoscopy with possible infrared coagulation of suspected internal hemorrhoids. Both procedures were explained in detail including risks and complications such as adverse reaction to medication, as well as respiratory embarrassment, infection, bleeding, perforation, and possibility of missing a small polyp or tumor.4. Alternatives including upper GI series, flexible sigmoidoscopy, barium enema, and CT colonography were discussed; however, the patient agrees to proceed with the plan as outlined above.5. Due to her sister's history of colon polyps, she will likely be advised to have a repeat colonoscopy in 5 years or perhaps sooner pending the results of her baseline examination."
75,Gastroenterology,"PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a very pleasant 69-year-old Caucasian male whom we are asked to see primarily because of a family history of colon cancer, but the patient also has rectal bleeding on a weekly basis and also heartburn once every 1 or 2 weeks. The patient states that he had his first colonoscopy 6 years ago and it was negative. His mother was diagnosed with colon cancer probably in her 50s, but she died of cancer of the esophagus at age 86. The patient does have hemorrhoidal bleed about once a week. Otherwise, he denies any change in bowel habits, abdominal pain, or weight loss. He gets heartburn mainly with certain food such as raw onions and he has had it for years. It will typically occur every couple of weeks. He has had no dysphagia. He has never had an upper endoscopy.MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for hypertension, adult-onset diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and restless legs syndrome.SURGICAL HISTORY: Appendectomy as a child and cholecystectomy in 2003.MEDICATIONS: His medications are lisinopril 40 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily, metformin 1000 mg twice a day, Januvia 100 mg daily, clonazepam 10 mg at bedtime for restless legs syndrome, Crestor 10 mg nightly, and Flomax 0.4 mg daily.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is retired. He is married. He had 4 children. He quite smoking 25 years ago after a 35-year history of smoking. He does not drink alcohol.FAMILY HISTORY: Mother had colon cancer in her 50s, esophageal cancer in her 80s. Her mother smoked and drank. Father got a mesothelioma at age 65. There is a brother of 65 with hypertension.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He has had prostatitis with benign prostatic hypertrophy. He has some increased urinary frequency from a history of prostatitis. He has the heartburn, which is diet dependent and the frequent rectal bleeding. He also has restless legs syndrome at night. No cardio or pulmonary complaints. No weight loss.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Reveals a well-developed, well-nourished man in no acute distress. BP 112/70. Pulse 80 and regular. Respirations non-labored. Height 5 feet 7-1/2 inches. Weight 209 pounds. HEENT exam: Sclerae are anicteric. Pupils equal, conjunctivae clear. No gross oropharyngeal lesions. Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, or JVD. Lungs are clear to percussion and auscultation. Heart sounds are regular without murmur, gallop, or rub. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There are no masses. There is no hepatosplenomegaly. The bowel sounds are normal. Rectal examination: Deferred. Extremities have no clubbing, cyanosis or edema. Skin is warm and dry. The patient is alert and oriented with a pleasant affect and no gross motor deficits.IMPRESSION:1. Family history of colon cancer.2. Rectal bleeding.3. Heartburn and a family history of esophageal cancer.PLAN: I agree with the indications for repeat colonoscopy, which should be done at least every 5 years. Also, discussed IRC to treat bleeding and internal hemorrhoids if he is deemed to be an appropriate candidate at the time of his colonoscopy and the patient was agreeable. I am also a little concerned about his family history of esophageal cancer and his personal history of heartburn and suggested that we check him once for Barrett's esophagus. If he does not have it now then it should not be a significant risk in the future. The indications and benefits of EGD, colonoscopy, and IRC were discussed. The risks including sedation, bleeding, infection, and perforation were discussed. The importance of a good bowel prep so as to minimize missing any lesions was discussed. His questions were answered and informed consent obtained. It was a pleasure to care for this nice patient."
76,Gastroenterology,"HISTORY: A is a 55-year-old who I know well because I have been taking care of her husband. She comes for discussion of a screening colonoscopy. Her last colonoscopy was in 2002, and at that time she was told it was essentially normal. Nonetheless, she has a strong family history of colon cancer, and it has been almost four to five years so she wants to have a repeat colonoscopy. I told her that the interval was appropriate and that it made sense to do so. She denies any significant weight change that she cannot explain. She has had no hematochezia. She denies any melena. She says she has had no real change in her bowel habit but occasionally does have thin stools.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: On today's visit we reviewed her entire health history. Surgically she has had a stomach operation for ulcer disease back in 1974, she says. She does not know exactly what was done. It was done at a hospital in California which she says no longer exists. This makes it difficult to find out exactly what she had done. She also had her gallbladder and appendix taken out in the 1970s at the same hospital. Medically she has no significant problems and no true medical illnesses. She does suffer from some mild gastroparesis, she says.MEDICATIONS: Reglan 10 mg once a day.ALLERGIES: She denies any allergies to medications but is sensitive to medications that cause her to have ulcers, she says.SOCIAL HISTORY: She still smokes one pack of cigarettes a day. She was counseled to quit. She occasionally uses alcohol. She has never used illicit drugs. She is married, is a housewife, and has four children.FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for diabetes and cancer.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Essentially as mentioned above.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: A is a healthy appearing female in no apparent distress.VITAL SIGNS: Her vital signs reveal a weight of 164 pounds, blood pressure 140/90, temperature of 97.6 degrees F.HEENT: No cervical bruits, thyromegaly, or masses. She has no lymphadenopathy in the head and neck, supraclavicular, or axillary spaces bilaterally.LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rubs, or rhonchi.HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub, or gallop.ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended.EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema, with good pulses in the radial arteries bilaterally.NEURO: No focal deficits, is intact to soft touch in all four.ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: In light of her history and physical, clearly the patient would be well served with an upper and lower endoscopy. We do not know what the anatomy is, and if she did have an antrectomy, she needs to be checked for marginal ulcers. She also complains of significant reflux and has not had an upper endoscopy in over five to six years as well. I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternatives to upper and lower endoscopy, and these include over sedation, perforation, and dehydration, and she wants to proceed.We will schedule her for an upper and lower endoscopy at her convenience."
77,Gastroenterology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: ""I want my colostomy reversed.""HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. A is a pleasant 43-year-old African-American male who presents to our clinic for a colostomy reversal as well as repair of an incisional hernia. The patient states that in November 2007, he presented to High Point Regional Hospital with sharp left lower quadrant pain and was emergently taken to Surgery where he woke up with a ""bag."" According to some notes that were faxed to our office from the surgeon in High Point who performed his initial surgery, Dr. X, the patient had diverticulitis with perforated sigmoid colon, and underwent a sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch. The patient was unaware of his diagnosis; therefore, we discussed that with him today in clinic. The patient also complains of the development of an incisional hernia since his surgery in November. He was seen back by Dr. X in April 2008 and hopes that Dr. X may reverse his colostomy and repair his hernia since he did his initial surgery, but because the patient has lost his job and has no insurance, he was referred to our clinic by Dr. X. Currently, the patient does state that his hernia bothers him more so than his colostomy, and if it were not for the hernia then he may just refrain from having his colostomy reversed; however, the hernia has grown in size and causing him significant discomfort. He feels that he always has to hold his hand over the hernia to prevent it from prolapsing and causing him even more discomfort.PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.2. Question of hypertension.3. Status post sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch in November 2007 at High Point Regional.4. Status post cholecystectomy.7. Status post unknown foot surgery.MEDICATIONS: None.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in Greensboro. He smokes one pack of cigarettes a day and has done so for 15 years. He denies any IV drug use and has an occasional alcohol.FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Please see history of present illness; otherwise, the review of systems is negative.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 95.9, pulse 67, blood pressure 135/79, and weight 208 pounds.GENERAL: This is a pleasant African-American male appearing his stated age in no acute distress.HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Moist mucous membranes. Extraocular movements intact.NECK: Supple, no JVD, and no lymphadenopathy.CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm.LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended with a left lower quadrant stoma. The stoma is pink, protuberant, and productive. The patient also has a midline incisional hernia approximately 6 cm in diameter. It is reducible. Otherwise, there are no further hernias or masses noted.EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 43-year-old gentleman who underwent what sounds like a sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch in November of 2007 secondary to perforated colon from diverticulitis. The patient presents for reversal of his colostomy as well as repair of his incisional hernia. I have asked the patient to return to High Point Regional and get his medical records including the operative note and pathology results from his initial surgery so that I would have a better idea of what was done during his initial surgery. He stated that he would try and do this and bring the records to our clinic on his next appointment. I have also set him up for a barium enema to study the rectal stump. He will return to us in two weeks at which time we will review his radiological studies and his medical records from the outside hospital and determine the best course of action from that point. This was discussed with the patient as well as his sister and significant other in the clinic today. They were in agreement with this plan. We also called the social worker to come and help the patient get more ostomy appliances, as he stated that he had no more and he was having to reuse the existing ostomy bag. To my understanding, his social worker, as well as the ostomy nurses were able to get him some assistance with this."
78,Gastroenterology,"EXAM: CT Abdomen & Pelvis W&WO ContrastREASON FOR EXAM: Status post aortobiiliac graft repair. TECHNIQUE: 5 mm spiral thick spiral CT scanning was performed through the entire abdomen and pelvis utilizing intravenous dynamic bolus contrast enhancement. No oral or rectal contrast was utilized. Comparison is made with the prior CT abdomen and pelvis dated 10/20/05. There has been no significant change in size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm centered roughly at the renal artery origin level which has dimensions of 3.7 cm transversely x 3.4 AP.

Approximately one year ago, he was involved in a motor vehicle accident and CT scan at that time showed that he had a hiatal hernia. Over the past year, this has caused him an increasing number of problems, including chest pain when he eats, and shortness of breath after large meals. He is also having reflux symptoms again. He presents to us for repair of the hiatal hernia and revision of the Nissen fundoplication.HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. A was admitted to the adolescent floor by Brenner Children's Hospital after his procedure. He was stable at that time. He did complain of some nausea. However, he did not have any vomiting at that time. He had an NG tube in and was n.p.o. He also had a PCA for pain management as well as Toradol. On postoperative day #1, he complained of not being able to urinate, so a Foley catheter was placed. Over the next several days, his hospital course proceeded as follows. He continued to complain of some nausea; however, he did not ever have any vomiting. Eventually, the Foley catheter was discontinued and he had excellent urine output without any complications. He ambulated frequently. He remained n.p.o. for three days. He also had the NG tube in during that time. On postoperative day #4, he began to have some flatus, and the NG tube was discontinued. He was advanced to a liquid diet and tolerated this without any complications. At this time, he was still using the PCA for pain control. However, he was using it much less frequently than on days #1 and #2 postoperatively. After tolerating the full liquid diet without any complications, he was advanced to a soft diet and his pain medications were transitioned to p.o. medications rather than the PCA. The PCA was discontinued. He tolerated the soft diet without any complications and continued to have flatus frequently. On postoperative day #6, it was determined that he was stable for discharge to home as he was taking p.o. without any complications. His pain was well controlled with p.o. pain medications. He was passing gas frequently, had excellent urine output, and was ambulating frequently without any issues.DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.DISPOSITION: Discharged to home.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was discharged to home with instructions for maintaining a soft diet. It was also recommended that he does not drink any soda postoperatively. He is instructed to keep his incision site clean and dry and it was also recommended that he avoid any heavy lifting. He will be able to attend school when it starts in a few weeks. However, he is not going to be able to play football in the near future. He was given prescription for pain medication upon discharge. He is instructed to contact Pediatric Surgery if he has any fevers, any nausea and vomiting, any chest pain, any constipation, or any other concerns."

She was afebrile. She was taken by Dr. X to the operating room.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent a procedure. She tolerated without difficulty. She had her pain controlled with p.o. pain medicine. She was afebrile. She is tolerating liquid diet. It was felt that the patient is stable for discharge. She did complain of bladder spasms when she urinated and she did say that she has a history of chronic UTIs. We will check a UA and urine culture prior to discharge. I will give her prescription for ciprofloxacin that she can take for 3 days presumptively and I have discharged her home with omeprazole and Colace to take over-the-counter for constipation and we will send her home with Percocet for pain. Her labs were within normal limits. She did have an elevated white blood cell count, but I believe this is just leukemoid reaction, but she is afebrile, and if she does have UTI, may also be related. Her labs in terms of her bilirubin were within normal limits. Her LFTs were slightly elevated, I do believe this is related to the cautery used on the liver bed. They were 51 and 83 for the AST and ALT respectively. I feel that she looks good for discharge.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: Clear liquid diet x48 hours and she can return to her Medifast, she may shower. She needs to keep her wound clean and dry. She is not to engage in any heavy lifting greater than 10 pounds x2 weeks. No driving for 1 to 2 weeks.

Meckel's diverticulectomy.4. Open incidental appendectomy.5. Peritoneal toilet.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 300 ml.URINE OUTPUT: 200 ml.TOTAL FLUID: 1600 mL.DRAIN: JP x1 right lower quadrant and anterior to the rectum.TUBES: Include an NG and a Foley catheter.SPECIMENS: Include Meckel's diverticulum and appendix.COMPLICATIONS: Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure with hypoxemia following closure.BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 45-year-old Caucasian gentleman presented to ABCD General Hospital with acute onset of right lower quadrant pain that began 24 hours prior to this evaluation.The pain was very vague and progressed in intensity. The patient has had anorexia with decrease in appetite. His physical examination revealed the patient to be febrile with the temperature of 102.4. He had right lower quadrant and suprapubic tenderness with palpation with Rovsing sign and rebound consistent with acute surgical abdomen. The patient was presumed acute appendicitis and was placed on IV antibiotics and recommended that he undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with possible open exploratory laparotomy. He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and gave informed consent to proceed.OPERATIVE FINDINGS: Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed purulent drainage within the region of the right lower quadrant adjacent to the cecum and terminal ileum. There was large amounts of purulent drainage. The appendix was visualized, however, it was difficult to be visualized secondary to the acute inflammatory process, purulent drainage, and edema. It was decided given the signs of perforation and purulent drainage within the abdomen that we would convert to an open exploratory laparotomy. Upon exploration of the ileum, there was noted to be a ruptured Meckel's diverticulum, this was resected. Additionally, the appendix appeared normal without evidence of perforation and/or edema and a decision to proceed with incidental appendectomy was performed. The patient was irrigated with copious amounts of warmth normal saline approximately 2 to 3 liters. The patient was closed and did develop some hypoxemia after closure. He remained ventilated and was placed on a large amount of ________. His hypoxia did resolve and he remained intubated and proceed to the Critical Care Complex or postop surgical care.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position. He did receive preoperative IV antibiotics, sequential compression devices, NG tube placement with Foley catheter, and heparin subcutaneously. The patient was intubated by the Anesthesia Department. After adequate anesthesia was obtained, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution. Utilizing a #10 blade scalpel, an infraumbilical incision was created. The Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen. The abdomen was insufflated to approximately 15 mmHg. A #10 mm ablated trocar was inserted into the abdomen and a video laparoscope was inserted and the abdomen was explored and the above findings were noted. A right upper quadrant 5 mm port was inserted to help with manipulation of bowel and to visualize the appendix. Decision was then made to convert to exploratory laparotomy given the signs of acute perforation. The instruments were then removed. The abdomen was then deflated. Utilizing ________ #10 blade scalpel, a midline incision was created from the xiphoid down to level of the pubic symphysis.The incision was carried down with a #10 blade scalpel and the bleeding was controlled along the way with electrocautery. The posterior layer of the rectus fascia and peritoneum was opened carefully with the scissors as the peritoneum had already been penetrated during laparoscopy. Incision was carried down to the midline within the linea alba. Once the abdomen was opened, there was noted to be gross purulent drainage. The ileum was explored and there was noted to be a perforated Meckel's diverticulum. Decision to resect the diverticulum was performed.The blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was carefully dissected free and a #3-0 Vicryl was used to tie off the blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum. Clamps were placed to the proximal supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was tied off with #3-0 Vicryl sutures. The Meckel's diverticulum was noted to be completely free and was grasped anteriorly and utilizing a GIA stapling device, the diverticulum was transected. There was noted to be a hemostatic region within the transection and staple line looked intact without evidence of perforation and/or leakage. Next, decision was decided to go ahead and perform an appendectomy. Mesoappendix was doubly clamped with hemostats and cut with Metzenbaum scissors. The appendiceal artery was identified and was clamped between two hemostats and transected as well. Once the appendix was completely freed of the surrounding inflammation and adhesion. A plain gut was placed at the base of the appendix and tied down. The appendix was milked distally with a straight stat and clamped approximately halfway. A second piece of plain gut suture was used to ligate above and then was transected with a #10 blade scalpel. The appendiceal stump was then inverted with a pursestring suture of #2-0 Vicryl suture. Once the ________ was completed, decision to place a JP drain within the right lower quadrant was performed. The drain was positioned within the right lower quadrant and anterior to the rectum and brought out through a separate site in the anterior abdominal wall. It was sewn in place with a #3-0 nylon suture. The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of warmed normal saline. The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable for pathology. The omentum was replaced over the bowel contents and utilizing #1-0 PDS suture, the abdominal wall, anterior and posterior rectus fascias were closed with a running suture. Once the abdomen was completely closed, the subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the incision was closed with staples. The previous laparoscopic sites were also closed with staples. Sterile dressings were placed over the wound with Adaptic and 4x4s and covered with ABDs. JPs replaced with bulb suction. NG tube and Foley catheter were left in place. The patient tolerated this procedure well with exception of hypoxemia which resolved by the conclusion of the case.The patient will proceed to the Critical Care Complex where he will be closely evaluated and followed in his postoperative course. To remain on IV antibiotics and we will manage ventilatory-dependency of the patient."

97,Gastroenterology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly, this is a 17-year-old male, who has had problems with dysphagia to solids and recently had food impacted in the lower esophagus. He is now having upper endoscopy to evaluate the esophagus after edema and inflammation from the food impaction has resolved, to look for any stricture that may need to be dilated, or any other mucosal abnormality.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: EGD.PREP: Cetacaine spray, 100 mcg of fentanyl IV, and 5 mg of Versed IV.FINDINGS: The tip of the endoscope was introduced into the esophagus, and the entire length of the esophagus was dotted with numerous, white, punctate lesions, suggestive of eosinophilic esophagitis. There were come concentric rings present. There was no erosion or flame hemorrhage, but there was some friability in the distal esophagus. Biopsies throughout the entire length of the esophagus from 25-40 cm were obtained to look for eosinophilic esophagitis. There was no stricture or Barrett mucosa. The bony and the antrum of the stomach are normal without any acute peptic lesions. Retroflexion of the tip of the endoscope in the body of the stomach revealed a normal cardia. There were no acute lesions and no evidence of ulcer, tumor, or polyp. The pylorus was easily entered, and the first, second, and third portions of the duodenum are normal. Adverse reactions: None.FINAL IMPRESSION: Esophageal changes suggestive of eosinophilic esophagitis. Biopsies throughout the length of the esophagus were obtained for microscopic analysis. There was no evidence of stricture, Barrett, or other abnormalities in the upper GI tract."

Antral mass.ANESTHESIA: Conscious sedation with Demerol and Versed.SPECIMEN: Antrum and fundal polyps.HISTORY: The patient is a 66-year-old African-American female who presented to ABCD Hospital with mental status changes. She has been anemic as well with no gross evidence of blood loss. She has had a decreased appetite with weight loss greater than 20 lb over the past few months. After discussion with the patient and her daughter, she was scheduled for EGD and colonoscopy for evaluation.PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite. She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation. When adequate level of sedation was achieved, a digital rectal exam was performed, which demonstrated no masses and no hemorrhoids. The colonoscope was inserted into the rectum and air was insufflated. The scope was coursed through the rectum and sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon to the level of the cecum. There were no polyps, masses, diverticuli, or areas of inflammation. The scope was then slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls. Air was aspirated. Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed. There was no evidence of perianal disease. No source of the anemia was identified.Attention was then taken for performing an EGD. The gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and was entered into the hypopharynx. The esophagus was easily intubated and traversed. There were no abnormalities of the esophagus. The stomach was entered and was insufflated. The scope was coursed along the greater curvature towards the antrum. Adjacent to the pylorus, towards the anterior surface, was a mass like lesion with a central _______. It was not clear if this represents a healing ulcer or neoplasm. Several biopsies were taken. The mass was soft. The pylorus was then entered. The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined. There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, or bleeding. The scope was then brought back into the antrum and was retroflexed. In the fundus and body, there was evidence of streaking and inflammation. There were also several small sessile polyps, which were removed with biopsy forceps. Biopsy was also taken for CLO. A hiatal hernia was present as well. Air was aspirated. The scope was slowly withdrawn. The GE junction was unremarkable. The scope was fully withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition. She will undergo a CAT scan of her abdomen and pelvis to further assess any possible adenopathy or gastric obstructional changes.

Intractable nausea, vomiting, and dysphagia.3. Enterogastritis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: EGD with PEG tube placement using Russell technique.ANESTHESIA: IV sedation with 1% lidocaine for local.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None.COMPLICATIONS: None.BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 44-year-old African-American female who is well known to this service. She has been hospitalized multiple times for intractable nausea and vomiting and dehydration. She states that her decreased p.o. intake has been progressively worsening. She was admitted to the service of Dr. Lang and was evaluated by Dr. Wickless as well all of whom agreed that the best option for supplemental nutrition for this patient was placement of a PEG tube.PROCEDURE: After risks, complications, and benefits were explained to the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room. She was placed in the supine position. The area was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion. After adequate IV sedation was obtained by anesthesia, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed. The esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were visualized without difficulty. There was no gross evidence of any malignancy. There was some enterogastritis which was noted upon exam. The appropriate location was noted on the anterior wall of the stomach. This area was localized externally with 1% lidocaine. Large gauge needle was used to enter the lumen of the stomach under visualization. A guide wire was then passed again under visualization and the needle was subsequently removed. A scalpel was used to make a small incision, next to the guidewire and ensuring that the underlying fascia was nicked as well. A dilator with break-away sheath was then inserted over the guidewire and under direct visualization was seen to enter the lumen of the stomach without difficulty. The guidewire and dilator were then removed again under visualization and the PEG tube was placed through the break-away sheath and visualized within the lumen of the stomach. The balloon was then insufflated and the break-away sheath was then pulled away. Proper placement of the tube was ensured through visualization with a scope. The tube was then sutured into place using nylon suture. Appropriate sterile dressing was applied.DISPOSITION: The patient was transferred to the recovery in a stable condition. She was subsequently returned to her room on the General Medical Floor. Previous orders will be resumed. We will instruct the Nursing that the PEG tube can be used at 5 p.m. this evening for medications if necessary and bolus feedings."
102,Gastroenterology,"The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and the above medications were administered. The oropharynx was sprayed with Cetacaine. The endoscope was passed under direct visualization into the esophagus. The entire esophageal mucosa was normal. The entire gastric mucosa was normal, including a retroflexed view of the fundus. The entire duodenal mucosa was normal to the second portion. The patient tolerated the procedure without complication."

104,Gastroenterology,"The patient was sedated with intravenous fentanyl 75 mcg and intravenous Versed, 5 mg, both titrated over the first ten minutes of the procedure time to achieve adequate sedation for the procedure. Cetacaine spray was applied to the hypopharynx for local anesthesia. The upper endoscope was passed,without difficulty, into the upper GI tract. The anatomy and mucosa of the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, stomach, pylorus, and small bowel were all carefully inspected. All structures were visually normal in appearance. Biopsies of the distal duodenum, gastric antrum, and distal esophagus were taken and sent for pathological evaluation. The endoscope and insufflated air were slowly removed from the upper GI tract. A repeat look at the structures involved again showed no visible abnormalities, except for the biopsy sites.The patient tolerated the procedure with excellent comfort and stable vital signs. After a recovery period in the Endoscopy Suite, the patient is discharged to continue recovering in the family's care at home. The family knows to follow up with me today if there are concerns about the patient's recoveryfrom the procedure. They will follow up with me later this week for biopsy and CLO test results so that appropriate further diagnostic and therapeutic plans can be made."
105,Gastroenterology,"The patient was taken to the GI lab and placed in the left lateral supine position. Continuous pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitoring were in place during the procedure. After informed consent was obtained, the video endoscope was inserted over the dorsum of the tongue without difficulty. The scope was advanced down the esophagus and into the body of the stomach. The scope was further advanced to the pylorus and into the duodenum. The duodenum was visualized well into its second portion and was free of stricture, neoplasm, or ulceration. Retroflexion view of the fundus was normal without evidence of abnormality. The scope was then slowly removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
106,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: EGD with biopsy.INDICATION: Mrs. ABC is a pleasant 45-year-old female with a history of severe diabetic gastroparesis, who had a gastrojejunal feeding tube placed radiologically approximately 2 months ago. She was admitted because of recurrent nausea and vomiting, with displacement of the GEJ feeding tube. A CT scan done yesterday revealed evidence of feeding tube remnant still seen within the stomach. The endoscopy is done to confirm this and remove it, as well as determine if there are any other causes to account for her symptoms. Physical examination done prior to the procedure was unremarkable, apart from upper abdominal tenderness.MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl 25 mcg, Versed 2 mg, 2% lidocaine spray to the pharynx.INSTRUMENT: GIF 160.PROCEDURE REPORT: Informed consent was obtained from Mrs. ABC's sister, after the risks and benefits of the procedure were carefully explained, which included but were not limited to bleeding, infection, perforation, and allergic reaction to the medications. Consent was not obtained from Mrs. Morales due to her recent narcotic administration. Conscious sedation was achieved with the patient lying in the left lateral decubitus position. The endoscope was then passed through the mouth, into the esophagus, the stomach, where retroflexion was performed, and it was advanced into the second portion of the duodenum.FINDINGS:1. ESOPHAGUS: There was evidence of grade C esophagitis, with multiple white-based ulcers seen from the distal to the proximal esophagus, at 12 cm in length. Multiple biopsies were obtained from this region and placed in jar #1.2. STOMACH: Small hiatal hernia was noted within the cardia of the stomach. There was an indentation/scar from the placement of the previous PEG tube and there was suture material noted within the body and antrum of the stomach. The remainder of the stomach examination was normal. There was no feeding tube remnant seen within the stomach.3. DUODENUM: This was normal.COMPLICATIONS: None.ASSESSMENT:1. Grade C esophagitis seen within the distal, mid, and proximal esophagus.2. Small hiatal hernia.3. Evidence of scarring at the site of the previous feeding tube, as well as suture line material seen in the body and antrum of the stomach.PLAN: Followup results of the biopsies and will have radiology replace her gastrojejunal feeding tube."
107,Gastroenterology,"TYPE OF PROCEDURE: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal pain.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Normal endoscopy.PREMEDICATION: Fentanyl 125 mcg IV, Versed 8 mg IV.INDICATIONS: This healthy 28-year-old woman has had biliary colic-type symptoms for the past 3-1/2 weeks, characterized by severe pain, and brought on by eating greasy foods. She has had similar episodes couple of years ago and was told, at one point, that she had gallstones, but after her pregnancy, a repeat ultrasound was done, and apparently was normal, and nothing was done at that time. She was evaluated in the emergency department recently, when she developed this recurrent pain, and laboratory studies were unrevealing. Ultrasound was normal and a HIDA scan was done, which showed a low normal ejection fraction of 40%, and moderate reproduction of her pain. Endoscopy was requested to make sure there is not upper GI source of her pain before considering cholecystectomy.PROCEDURE: The patient was premedicated and the Olympus GIF 160 video endoscope advanced to the distal duodenum. Gastric biopsies were taken to rule out Helicobacter and the procedure was completed without complication.IMPRESSION: Normal endoscopy.PLAN: Refer to a general surgeon for consideration of cholecystectomy."
108,Gastroenterology,"INDICATION: Recurrent dysphagia.PREMEDICATIONS: See procedure nurse NCS form. PROCEDURE: Consent PAR conference was held. After signing the informed consent, premedications were given. The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and monitored with blood pressure cuff and pulse oximeter throughout the procedure. Hurricaine spray was placed in the back of the throat. The Olympus endoscope was passed under direct visualization through the cricopharyngeus into the esophageal area. It was passed through the esophagus with identification of the EG junction and into the stomach. A portion of the stomach and the rugal folds were visualized. The scope was passed into the antral area with visualization of the pylorus. The pylorus was cannulated and the duodenal bulb and the second position of the duodenum were visualized. The scope was passed back into the stomach where the cardia, fundus, and lesser curvature were visualized in a retrograde manner. The following findings were noted: FINDINGS: 1. The esophagus was significantly tortuous and somewhat shortened with a large hiatal hernia with the EG junction at approximately 30 cm. It was difficult to tell if there was significant narrowing in the esophagus with the significant tortuosity and the scope passing into the stomach. No resistance was noted to the endoscope.2. The stomach was abnormal with a very large sliding type hiatal hernia.3. The duodenum was normal.4. A Savary wire was placed in the antrum and the scope was removed. Positioning the wire by markings, a #14 French dilator was passed without difficulty into the stomach area. There was some resistance to a #16 French dilator, although at that time it had passed to approximately 40 cm and I suspect we were through the EG junction area. This may have been curling in the hiatal hernia, I opted not to use further force to advance the dilator further.The scope was removed and the patient tolerated the procedure well. IMPRESSION: Very large hiatal hernia and tortuous esophagus, probably with mild peptic stricture, dilated to #14 French. I may even have gotten the #16 French dilator through, but it was not passed all the way into the stomach area because of some resistance which I suspect was curling in the hiatal hernia.PLAN: I will have her follow up with my nurse practitioner in approximately 10 days. If her dysphagia is improved, we will simply observe. If she continues to have dysphagia, we will bring her back and attempt to re-dilate her with a #15 French dilator. She will continue Aciphex long term."

She has a previous history of hiatal hernia. She was on Prevacid currently. At this time, an EGD was performed to rule out stricture. At the time of EGD, there was noted some antral gastritis and hiatal hernia. There are no strictures, tumors, masses, or varices present.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the Endoscopy Suite in the lateral decubitus position. She was given sedation by the Department Of Anesthesia. Once adequate sedation was reached, the Olympus gastroscope was inserted into oropharynx. With air insufflation entered through the proximal esophagus to the GE junction. The esophagus was without evidence of tumors, masses, ulcerations, esophagitis, strictures, or varices. There was a hiatal hernia present. The scope was passed through the hiatal hernia into the body of the stomach. In the distal antrum, there was some erythema with patchy erythematous changes with small superficial erosions. Multiple biopsies were obtained. The scope was passed through the pylorus into the duodenal bulb and duodenal suite, they appeared within normal limits. The scope was pulled back from the stomach, retroflexed upon itself, _____ fundus and GE junction. As stated, multiple biopsies were obtained.The scope was then slowly withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well and sent to recovery room in satisfactory condition."

The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.IMPRESSION:1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease, biopsied.2. Distal esophageal reflux-induced stricture, dilated to 18 mm.3. Otherwise normal upper endoscopy.PLAN:I will await the results of the biopsies. The patient was told to continue maintenance Aciphex and anti-reflux precautions. He will follow up with me on a p.r.n. basis."
112,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Melena.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Solitary erosion over a fold at the GE junction, gastric side.PREMEDICATIONS: Versed 5 mg IV.REPORTED PROCEDURE: The Olympus gastroscope was used. The scope was placed in the upper esophagus under direct visit. The esophageal mucosa was entirely normal. There was no evidence of erosions or ulceration. There was no evidence of varices. The body and antrum of the stomach were normal. They pylorus duodenum bulb and descending duodenum are normal. There was no blood present within the stomach.The scope was then brought back into the stomach and retroflexed in order to inspect the upper portion of the body of the stomach. When this was done, a prominent fold was seen lying along side the GE junction along with gastric side and there was a solitary erosion over this fold. The lesion was not bleeding. If this fold were in any other location of the stomach, I would consider the fold, but at this location, one would have to consider that this would be an isolated gastric varix. As such, the erosion may be more significant. There was no bleeding. Obviously, no manipulation of the lesion was undertaken. The scope was then straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated.ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION:1. Solitary erosion overlying a prominent fold at the gastroesophageal junction, gastric side � may simply be an erosion or may be an erosion over a varix.2. Otherwise unremarkable endoscopy - no evidence of a bleeding lesion of the stomach.PLAN:1. Liver profile today.2. Being Nexium 40 mg a day.3. Scheduled colonoscopy for next week."
113,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Endoscopy.INDICATIONS: Dysphagia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal ring and active reflux esophagitis.PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure from the parents and patient. The oral cavity is sprayed with lidocaine spray. A bite block is placed. Versed IV 5 mg and 100 mcg of IV fentanyl was given in cautious increments. The GIF-160 diagnostic gastroscope used. The patient was alert during the procedure. The esophagus was intubated under direct visualization. The scope was advanced toward the GE junction with active reflux esophagitis involving the distal one-third of the esophagus noted. The stomach was unremarkable. Retroflexed exam unremarkable. Duodenum not intubated in order to minimize the time spent during the procedure. The patient was alert although not combative. A balloon was then inserted across the GE junction, 15 mm to 18 mm, and inflated to 3, 4.7, and 7 ATM, and left inflated at 18 mm for 45 seconds. The balloon was then deflated. The patient became uncomfortable and a good-size adequate distal esophageal tear was noted. The scope and balloon were then withdrawn. The patient left in good condition.IMPRESSION: Successful dilation of distal esophageal fracture in the setting of active reflux esophagitis albeit mild.PLAN: I will recommend that the patient be on lifelong proton pump inhibition and have repeat endoscopy performed as needed. This has been discussed with the parents. He was sent home with a prescription for omeprazole."
114,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Endoscopy.CLINICAL INDICATIONS: Intermittent rectal bleeding with abdominal pain.ANESTHESIA: Fentanyl 100 mcg and 5 mg of IV Versed.PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the GI lab and placed in the left lateral supine position. Continuous pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitoring were in place. After informed consent was obtained, the video endoscope was inserted over the dorsum of the tongue without difficulty. With swallowing, the scope was advanced down the esophagus into the body of the stomach. The scope was further advanced down to the antrum and through the pylorus into the duodenum, which was visualized into its second portion. It appeared free of stricture, neoplasm, or ulceration. Samples were obtained from the antrum and prepyloric area to check for Helicobacter, rapid urease, and additional samples were sent to pathology. Retroflexion view of the fundus of the stomach was normal without evidence of a hiatal hernia. The scope was then slowly removed. The distal esophagus appeared benign with a normal-appearing gastroesophageal sphincter and no esophagitis. The remaining portion of the esophagus was normal.IMPRESSION: Abdominal pain. Symptoms most consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease without endoscopic evidence of hiatal hernia.RECOMMENDATIONS: Await results of CLO testing and biopsies. Return to clinic with Dr. Spencer in 2 weeks for further discussion."
115,Gastroenterology,INDICATIONS: Dysphagia.PREMEDICATION: Topical Cetacaine spray and Versed IV.PROCEDURE:: The scope was passed into the esophagus under direct vision. The esophageal mucosa was all unremarkable. There was no evidence of any narrowing present anywhere throughout the esophagus and no evidence of esophagitis. The scope was passed on down into the stomach. The gastric mucosa was all examined including a retroflexed view of the fundus and there were no abnormalities seen. The scope was then passed into the duodenum and the duodenal bulb and second and third portions of the duodenum were unremarkable. The scope was again slowly withdrawn through the esophagus and no evidence of narrowing was present. The scope was then withdrawn.IMPRESSION: Normal upper GI endoscopy without any evidence of anatomical narrowing.
116,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Upper endoscopy with biopsy.PROCEDURE INDICATION: This is a 44-year-old man who was admitted for coffee-ground emesis, which has been going on for the past several days. An endoscopy is being done to evaluate for source of upper GI bleeding.Informed consent was obtained. Outlining the risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure included, but not to risks of bleeding, infection, perforation, the patient agreed for the procedure.MEDICATIONS: Versed 4 mg IV push and fentanyl 75 mcg IV push given throughout the procedure in incremental fashion with careful monitoring of patient's pressures and vital signs.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Medications were given. After adequate sedation was achieved, the Olympus video endoscope was inserted into the mouth and advanced towards the duodenum. Mucosa ___________. The duodenum appeared normal. The scope was then brought back to the stomach. The antrum and angularis appeared normal as well. The scope was retroflexed to visualize the mucosa of rugal folds, the body, and fundus of the stomach. At the cardia, there was a large fungating ulcerated mass appreciated, which was oozing blood. Biopsies were taken of this mass, which was very firm and likely representing a carcinoma. The scope was then anteflexed and brought back to the distal esophagus. All the esophageal mucosa appeared normal. The squamocolumnar junction appeared normal as well. The scope was removed and procedure terminated. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications.IMPRESSION:1. Normal esophagus.2. Normal duodenum.3. Ulcerated fungating mass at the cardia of the stomach status post biopsies.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. CT chest, abdomen and pelvis for staging.2. Check CEA.3. Transfuse as needed.4. Await biopsy results.5. Oncology consult, pending biopsy results."
117,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal aortic aneurysm.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal aortic aneurysm.OPERATION PERFORMED: Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.FINDINGS: The patient was brought to the OR with the known 4 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm + 2.5 cm right common iliac artery aneurysm. A Gore exclusive device was used 3 pieces were used to effect the repair. We had to place an iliac extender down in to right external iliac artery to manage the right common iliac artery aneurysm. The right hypogastric artery had been previously coiled off. Left common femoral artery was used for the _____ side. We had small type 2 leak right underneath the take off the renal arteries, this was not felt to be type I leak and this was very delayed filling and it was felt that this was highly indicative of type 2 leak from a lumbar artery, which commonly come off in this area. It was felt that this would seal after reversal of the anticoagulation given sufficient time.PROCEDURE: With the patient supine position under general anesthesia, the abdomen and lower extremities were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.Bilateral groin incisions were made, and the common femoral arteries were dissected out bilaterally. The patient was then heparinized.The 7-French sheaths were then placed retrograde bilaterally.A stiff Amplatz wires were then placed up the right femoral artery and a stiff Amplatz were placed left side a calibrated catheter was placed up the right side. The calibrated aortogram was the done. We marked the renal arteries aortic bifurcation and bifurcation, common iliac arteries. We then preceded placement of the main trunk, by replacing the 7 French sheath in the left groin area with 18-french sheath and then deployed the trunk body just below the take off renal arteries.Once the main trunk has been deployed within wired _____ then deployed an iliac limb down in to the right common iliac artery. As noted above, we then had to place an iliac extension, down in the external iliac artery to exclude the right common iliac artery and resume completely.Following completion of the above all arteries were ballooned appropriately. A completion angiogram was done which showed late small type 2 leak just under the take off renal arteries. The area was ballooned aggressively. It was felt that this would dissolve as discussed above.Following completion of the above all wire sheaths etc., were removed from both groin areas. Both femoral arteries were repaired by primary suture technique. Flow was then reestablished to the lower extremities, and protamine was given to reverse the heparin.Both surgical sites were then irrigated thoroughly. Meticulous hemostasis was achieved. Both wounds were then closed in a routine layered fashion.Sterile antibiotic dressings were applied. Sponge and needle counts were reported as correct. The patient tolerated the procedure well the patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."
118,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Epigastric hernia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Epigastric hernia.OPERATIONS: Epigastric herniorrhaphy.ANESTHESIA: General inhalation.PROCEDURE: Following attainment of satisfactory anesthesia, the patient's abdomen was prepped with Hibiclens and draped sterilely. The hernia mass had been marked preoperatively. This area was anesthetized with a mixture of Marcaine and Xylocaine. A transverse incision was made over the hernia and dissection carried down to the entrapped fat. Sharp dissection was carried around the fat down to the fascial edge. The preperitoneal fat could not be reduced; therefore, it is trimmed away and the small fascial defect then closed with interrupted 0-Ethibond sutures. The fascial edges were injected with the local anesthetic mixture. Subcutaneous tissues were then closed with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl and skin edges closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Vicryl. Steri-Strips and a sterile dressing were applied to complete the closure. The patient was then awakened and taken to the PACU in satisfactory condition.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 10 mL.SPONGE AND NEEDLE COUNT: Reported as correct.COMPLICATIONS: None."

120,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with brush cytology and biopsy.INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: Patient with a history of chronic abdominal pain and CT showing evidence of chronic pancreatitis, with a recent upper endoscopy showing an abnormal-appearing ampulla.MEDICATIONS: General anesthesia.The risks of the procedure were made aware to the patient and consisted of medication reaction, bleeding, perforation, aspiration, and post ERCP pancreatitis.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent and appropriate sedation, the duodenoscope was inserted into the oropharynx, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. The scope was then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla. The ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance, as it was enlarged and very prominent. It extended outward with an almost polypoid shape. It had what appeared to be adenomatous-appearing mucosa on the tip. There also was ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla. The biliary and pancreatic orifices were identified. This was located not at the tip of the ampulla, but rather more towards the base. Cannulation was performed with a Wilson-Cooke TriTome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree. The common bile duct was mildly dilated, measuring approximately 12 mm. The intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated. There were no filling defects identified. There was felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct, but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla. The patient has no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically. Nevertheless, it was decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment. This was done without any complications. There was adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure. Multiple efforts were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy; however, because of the shape of the ampulla, this was unsuccessful. Efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position, but still were unsuccessful. Next, biopsies were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice. Four biopsies were taken. There was some minor oozing which had ceased by the end of the procedure. The stomach was then decompressed and the endoscope was withdrawn.FINDINGS:1. Abnormal papilla with bulging, polypoid appearance, and looks adenomatous with ulceration on the tip; biopsies taken.2. Cholangiogram reveals mildly dilated common bile duct measuring 12 mm and possible distal CBD stricture, although I think this is likely an anatomic variant; brush cytology obtained.3. Unable to access the pancreatic duct.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. NPO except ice chips today.2. Will proceed with MRCP to better delineate pancreatic ductal anatomy.3. Follow up biopsies and cytology."
121,Gastroenterology,"OPERATION1. Ivor-Lewis esophagogastrectomy.2. Feeding jejunostomy.3. Placement of two right-sided #28-French chest tubes.4. Right thoracotomy.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia with a dual-lumen tube.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered. Prior to administration of general anesthesia, the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed. In addition, he had a dual-lumen endotracheal tube placed. The patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure. His abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion. After applying sterile dressings, a #10-blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus. Dissection was carried down through the linea using Bovie electrocautery. The abdomen was opened. Next, a Balfour retractor was positioned as well as a mechanical retractor. Next, our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach. In an attempt to do so, we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade. We incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade. The omentum was divided using suture ligature with 2-0 silk. We did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 2-0 silk. Next, we turned our attention to performing a Kocher maneuver. This was done and the stomach was freed up. We took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm. We enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest. We also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area. The esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen. We next turned our attention to the left gastric artery. The left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach. We first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties. The left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2-0 stick tie reinforcement. At this point the stomach was freely mobile. We then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube. A 2-0 Vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. We then used Bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site. We placed a 16-French red rubber catheter through this site. We tied down in place. We then used 3-0 silk sutures to perform a Witzel. Next, the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2-0 silk ties. After doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately, we turned our attention to closing the abdomen. This was done with #1 Prolene. We put in a 2nd layer of 2-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.Next, we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure. The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. The right chest was prepped and draped appropriately. We then used a #10 blade scalpel to make an incision in a posterolateral, non-muscle-sparing fashion. Dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with Bovie electrocautery. Next, the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered. The lung was deflated. We placed standard chest retractors. Next, we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus. We dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein. The azygos vein, in fact, was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2-0 stick ties. As mentioned, we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus. After doing this, we backed our NG tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring. We used an automatic pursestring and applied. We then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with Metzenbaum scissors. We secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus. The pursestring was then tied down without difficulty. Next, we tabularized our stomach using a #80 GIA stapler. After doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using Bovie electrocautery. We placed our EEA stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall. We connected our anvil to the EEA stapler. This was then secured appropriately. We checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition. We then fired the stapler. We obtained 2 complete rings, 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach, which were sent for pathology. We also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology. Of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins. We then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening. This was closed with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion. We then buttressed this with serosal 3-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures. We returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it. Next, we placed two #28-French chest tubes, 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly, taking care not to place it near the anastomosis. We then closed the chest with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion. The lung was brought up. We closed the muscle layers with #0 Vicryl followed by #0 Vicryl; then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl. Sterile dressing was applied. The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the ICU in good condition."
122,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy and snare polypectomy.INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: Iron-deficiency anemia.MEDICATIONS: MAC.The risks of the procedure were made aware to the patient and consisted of medication reaction, bleeding, perforation, and aspiration.PROCEDURE: After informed consent and appropriate sedation, the upper endoscope was inserted into the oropharynx down into the stomach and beyond the pylorus and the second portion of the duodenum. The duodenal mucosa was completely normal. The pylorus was normal. In the stomach, there was evidence of diffuse atrophic-appearing nodular gastritis. Multiple biopsies were obtained. There also was a 1.5-cm adenomatous appearing polyp along the greater curvature at the junction of the body and antrum. There was mild ulceration on the tip of this polyp. It was decided to remove the polyp via snare polypectomy. Retroflexion was performed, and this revealed a small hiatal hernia in the distal esophagus. The Z-line was identified and was unremarkable. The esophageal mucosa was normal.FINDINGS:1. Hiatal hernia.2. Diffuse nodular and atrophic appearing gastritis, biopsies taken.3. A 1.5-cm polyp with ulceration along the greater curvature, removed.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Follow up biopsies.2. Continue PPI.3. Hold Lovenox for 5 days.4. Place SCDs."
123,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: A 1-year-10-month-old with a history of dysphagia to solids. The procedure was done to rule out organic disease.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Loose lower esophageal sphincter and duodenal ulcers.CONSENT: The consent is signed.MEDICATIONS: The procedure was done under general anesthesia given by Dr. Marino Fernandez.COMPLICATIONS: None.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: A history and physical examination were performed, and the procedure, indications, potential complications including bleeding, perforation, the need for surgery, infection, adverse medical reaction, risks, benefits, and alternatives available were explained to the parents, who stated good understanding and consented to go ahead with the procedure. The opportunity for questions was provided, and informed consent was obtained. Once the consent was obtained, the patient was sedated with IV medications and intubated by Dr. Fernandez and placed in the supine position. Then, the tip of the XP-160 videoscope was introduced into the oropharynx, and under direct visualization, we could advance the endoscope into the upper, mid, and lower esophagus. We did not find any strictures in the upper esophagus, but the patient had the lower esophageal sphincter totally loose. Then the tip of the endoscope was advanced down into the stomach and guided into the pylorus, and then into the first portion of the duodenum. We noticed that the patient had several ulcers in the first portion of the duodenum. Then the tip of the endoscope was advanced down into the second portion of the duodenum, one biopsy was taken there, and then, the tip of the endoscope was brought back to the first portion, and two biopsies were taken there. Then, the tip of the endoscope was brought back to the antrum, where two biopsies were taken, and one biopsy for CLOtest. By retroflexed view, at the level of the body of the stomach, I could see that the patient had the lower esophageal sphincter loose. Finally, the endoscope was unflexed and was brought back to the lower esophagus, where two biopsies were taken. At the end, air was suctioned from the stomach, and the endoscope was removed out of the patient's mouth. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.FINAL IMPRESSION: 1. Duodenal ulcers.2. Loose lower esophageal sphincter.PLAN:1. To start omeprazole 20 mg a day.2. To review the biopsies.3. To return the patient back to clinic in 1 to 2 weeks."
124,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Nausea and vomiting and upper abdominal pain.POST PROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Normal upper endoscopy.OPERATION: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with antral biopsies for H. pylori x2 with biopsy forceps.ANESTHESIA: IV sedation 50 mg Demerol, 8 mg of Versed.PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the endoscopy suite. After adequate IV sedation with the above medications, hurricane was sprayed in the mouth as well as in the esophagus. A bite block was placed and the gastroscope placed into the mouth and was passed into the esophagus and negotiated through the esophagus, stomach, and pylorus. The first, second, and third portions of the duodenum were normal. The scope was withdrawn into the antrum which was normal and two bites with the biopsy forceps were taken in separate spots for H. pylori. The scope was retroflexed which showed a normal GE junction from the inside of the stomach and no evidence of pathology or paraesophageal hernia. The scope was withdrawn at the GE junction which was in a normal position with a normal transition zone. The scope was then removed throughout the esophagus which was normal. The patient tolerated the procedure well.The plan is to obtain a HIDA scan as the right upper quadrant ultrasound appeared to be normal, although previous ultrasounds several years ago showed a gallstone."
125,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent right upper quadrant pain with failure of antacid medical therapy.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Normal esophageal gastroduodenoscopy.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with bile aspirate.ANESTHESIA: IV Demerol and Versed in titrated fashion.INDICATIONS: This 41-year-old female presents to surgical office with history of recurrent right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Despite antacid therapy, the patient's pain has continued. Additional findings were concerning with possibility of a biliary etiology. The patient was explained the risks and benefits of an EGD as well as a Meltzer-Lyon test where upon bile aspiration was performed. The patient agreed to the procedure and informed consent was obtained.GROSS FINDINGS: No evidence of neoplasia, mucosal change, or ulcer on examination. Aspiration of the bile was done after the administration of 3 mcg of Kinevac.PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient was placed in the supine position. After appropriate anesthesia was obtained, an Olympus gastroscope inserted from the oropharynx through the second portion of duodenum. Prior to this, 3 mcg of IV Kinevac was given to the patient to aid with the stimulation of bile. At this time, the patient as well complained of epigastric discomfort and nausea. This pain was similar to her previous pain.Bile was aspirated with a trap to enable the collection of the fluid. This fluid was then sent to lab for evaluation for crystals. Next, photodocumentation obtained and retraction of the gastroscope through the antrum revealed no other evidence of disease, retroflexion revealed no evidence of hiatal hernia or other mass and after straightening the scope and aspiration ________, gastroscope was retracted. The gastroesophageal junction was noted at 20 cm. No other evidence of disease was appreciated here. Retraction of the gastroscope backed through the esophagus, off the oropharynx, removed from the patient. The patient tolerated the procedure well. We will await evaluation of bile aspirate."
126,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.2. Hiatal hernia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.2. Hiatal hernia.3. Enterogastritis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, photography, and biopsy.GROSS FINDINGS: The patient has a history of epigastric abdominal pain, persistent in nature. She has a history of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease, takes Pepcid frequently. She has had a history of hiatal hernia. She is being evaluated at this time for disease process. She does not have much response from Protonix.Upon endoscopy, the gastroesophageal junction is approximately 40 cm. There appeared to be some inflammation at the gastroesophageal junction and a small 1 cm to 2 cm hiatal hernia. There is no advancement of the gastric mucosa up into the lower one-third of the esophagus. However there appeared to be inflammation as stated previously in the gastroesophageal junction. There was some mild inflammation at the antrum of the stomach. The fundus of the stomach was within normal limits. The cardia showed some laxity to the lower esophageal sphincter. The pylorus is concentric. The duodenal bulb and sweep are within normal limits. No ulcers or erosions.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient is taken to the Endoscopy Suite, prepped and draped in the left lateral decubitus position. The patient was given IV sedation using Demerol and Versed. Olympus videoscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and upon deglutition passed into the esophagus. Using air insufflation, panendoscope was advanced down the esophagus into the stomach along the greater curvature of the stomach through the pylorus into the duodenal bulb and sweep and the above gross findings were noted. Panendoscope was slowly withdrawn carefully examining the lumen of the bowel. Photographs were taken with the pathology present. Biopsy was obtained of the antrum of the stomach and also CLO test. The biopsy is also obtained of the gastroesophageal junction at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o' clock positions to rule out occult Barrett's esophagitis. Air was aspirated from the stomach and the panendoscope was removed. The patient sent to recovery room in stable condition."

An additional 50 mcg of fentanyl and 2 mg of midazolam were given following erythromycin. Scope tip of the Olympus gastroscope was passed into the esophagus. Proximal, middle, and distal thirds of the esophagus were well visualized. There was fresh blood in the esophagus, which was washed thoroughly, but no source was seen. No evidence of varices was seen. The stomach was entered. The stomach was filled with very large clot and fresh blood and liquid, which could not be suctioned due to the clot burden. There was a small amount of bright red blood near the fundus, but a source could not be identified due to the clot burden. Because of this, the gastroscope was withdrawn. The patient was given 250 mg of erythromycin in the Emergency Department and 30 minutes later, the scope was repassed. On the second look, the esophagus was cleared. The liquid gastric contents were cleared. There was still a moderate amount of clot burden in the stomach, but no active bleeding was seen. There was a small grade I esophageal varices, but no stigmata of bleed. There was also a small amount of fresh blood within the hiatal hernia, but no source of bleeding was identified. The patient was hemodynamically stable; therefore, a decision was made for a second look in the morning. The scope was withdrawn and air was suctioned. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery without immediate complications."

130,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy and colonoscopy with biopsy.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: A 17-year-old with history of 40-pound weight loss, abdominal pain, status post appendectomy with recurrent abscess formation and drainage. Currently, he has a fistula from his anterior abdominal wall out. It does not appear to connect to the gastrointestinal tract, but merely connect from the ventral surface of the rectus muscles out the abdominal wall. CT scans show thickened terminal ileum, which suggest that we are dealing with Crohn's disease. Endoscopy is being done to evaluate for Crohn's disease.MEDICATIONS: General anesthesia.INSTRUMENT: Olympus GIF-160 and PCF-160.COMPLICATIONS: None.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL.FINDINGS: With the patient in the supine position, intubated under general anesthesia. The endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx. The scope was advanced down the esophagus, which had normal mucosal coloration and vascular pattern. Lower esophageal sphincter was located at 40 cm from the central incisors. It appeared normal and appeared to function normally. The endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which was distended with excess air. Rugal folds were flattened completely. There were multiple superficial erosions scattered throughout the fundus, body, and antral portions consistent with Crohn's involvement of the stomach. The endoscope was advanced through normal-appearing pyloric valve into the first, second, and third portion of the duodenum, which had normal mucosal coloration and fold pattern. Biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of the duodenum, antrum, body, and distal esophagus at 37 cm from the central incisors for histology. Two additional biopsies were obtained in the antrum for CLO testing. Excess air was evacuated from the stomach. The scope was removed from the patient who tolerated that part of the procedure well.The patient was turned and scope was changed for colonoscopy. Prior to colonoscopy, it was noted that there was a perianal fistula at 7 o'clock. The colonoscope was then inserted into the anal verge. The colonic clean out was excellent. The scope was advanced without difficulty to the cecum. The cecal area had multiple ulcers with exudate. The ileocecal valve was markedly distorted. Biopsies were obtained x2 in the cecal area and then the scope was withdrawn through the ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectum. The colonic mucosa in these areas was well seen and there were a few scattered aphthous ulcers in the ascending and descending colon. Biopsies were obtained in the cecum at 65 cm, transverse colon 50 cm, rectosigmoid 20 cm, and rectum at 5 cm. No fistulas were noted in the colon. Excess air was evacuated from the colon. The scope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in satisfactory condition.IMPRESSION: Normal esophagus and duodenum. There were multiple superficial erosions or aphthous ulcers in the stomach along with a very few scattered aphthous ulcers in the colon with marked cecal involvement with large ulcers and a very irregular ileocecal valve. All these findings are consistent with Crohn's disease.PLAN: Begin prednisone 30 mg p.o. daily. Await PPD results and chest x-ray results, as well as cocci serology results. If these are normal, then we would recommend Remicade 5 mg/kg IV infusion. We would start Modulon 50 mL/h for 20 hours to reverse the malnutrition state of this boy. Check CMP and phosphate every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for receding syndrome noted by following potassium and phosphate. We will discuss with Dr. X possibly repeating the CT fistulogram if the findings on the previous ones are inconclusive as far as the noting whether we can rule in or out an enterocutaneous fistula. He will need an upper GI to rule out small intestinal strictures and involvement of the small intestine that cannot be seen with upper and lower endoscopy. If he has no stricture formation in the small bowel, we would then recommend a video endoscopy capsule to further evaluate any mucosal lesions consistent with Crohn's in the small intestine that we cannot visualize with endoscopy."
131,Gastroenterology,"MEDICATIONS:1. Versed intravenously.2. Demerol intravenously.DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: After informed consent, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and Cetacaine spray was applied to the posterior pharynx. The patient was sedated with the above medications. The Olympus video panendoscope was advanced under direct vision into the esophagus. The esophagus was normal in appearance and configuration. The gastroesophageal junction was normal. The scope was advanced into the stomach, where the fundic pool was aspirated and the stomach was insufflated with air. The gastric mucosa appeared normal. The pylorus was normal. The scope was advanced through the pylorus into the duodenal bulb, which was normal, then into the second part of the duodenum, which was normal as well. The scope was pulled back into the stomach. Retroflexed view showed a normal incisura, lesser curvature, cardia and fundus. The scope was straightened out, the air removed and the scope withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no apparent complications."
132,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Following premedication with Vistaril 50 mg and Atropine 0.4 mg IM, the patient received Versed 5.0 mg intravenously after Cetacaine spray to the posterior palate. The Olympus video gastroscope was then introduced into the upper esophagus and passed by direct vision to the descending duodenum. The upper, mid and lower portions of the esophagus; the lesser and greater curves of the stomach; anterior and posterior walls; body and antrum; pylorus; duodenal bulb; and duodenum were all normal. No evidence of friability, ulceration or tumor mass was encountered. The instrument was withdrawn to the antrum, and biopsies taken for CLO testing, and then the instrument removed."
133,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Positive peptic ulcer disease.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gastritis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with photography and biopsy.GROSS FINDINGS: The patient had a history of peptic ulcer disease, epigastric abdominal pain x2 months, being evaluated at this time for ulcer disease.Upon endoscopy, gastroesophageal junction was at 40 cm, no esophageal tumor, varices, strictures, masses, or no reflux esophagitis was noted. Examination of the stomach reveals mild inflammation of the antrum of the stomach, no ulcers, erosions, tumors, or masses. The profundus and the cardia of the stomach were unremarkable. The pylorus was concentric. The duodenal bulb and sweep with no inflammation, tumors, or masses.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient taken to the Endoscopy Suite, prepped and draped in the left lateral decubitus position. She was given IV sedation using Demerol and Versed. Olympus videoscope was inserted in the hypopharynx, upon deglutition passed into the esophagus. Using air insufflation, the scope was advanced down through the esophagus into the stomach along the greater curvature of the stomach to the pylorus to the duodenal bulb and sweep. The above gross findings noted. The panendoscope was withdrawn back from the stomach, deflected upon itself. The lesser curve fundus and cardiac were well visualized. Upon examination of these areas, panendoscope was returned to midline. Photographs and biopsies were obtained of the antrum of the stomach. Air was aspirated from the stomach and panendoscope was slowly withdrawn carefully examining the lumen of the bowel.Photographs and biopsies were obtained as appropriate. The patient is sent to recovery room in stable condition."

The patient was brought to the GI lab. There, she was placed in partial left lateral decubitus position. She was given IV sedation by Anesthesia. Her abdomen was prepped with alcohol and then Betadine. Flexible gastroscope was passed down the esophagus, through the stomach into the duodenum. No lesions were noted in the duodenum. There appeared to be a few polyps in the antral area, two in the antrum. Actually, one appeared to be almost covering the pylorus. The scope was withdrawn back into the antrum. On retroflexion, we could see a large hiatal hernia. No other lesions were noted. Biopsy was taken of one of the polyps. The scope was left in position. Anterior abdominal wall was prepped with Betadine, 1% Xylocaine was injected in the left epigastric area. A small stab incision was made and a large bore Angiocath was placed directly into the anterior abdominal wall, into the stomach, followed by a thread, was grasped with a snare using the gastroscope, brought out through the patient's mouth. Tied to the gastrostomy tube, which was then pulled down and up through the anterior abdominal wall. It was held in position with a dressing and a stent. A connector was applied to the cut gastrostomy tube, held in place with a 2-0 silk ligature. The patient tolerated the procedure well. She was returned to the floor in stable condition."

Protein-calorie malnutrition.PROCEDURES PERFORMED:1. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with photo.2. Insertion of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.ANESTHESIA: IV sedation and local.COMPLICATIONS: None.DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well without difficulty.BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 50-year-old African-American male who presented to ABCD General Hospital on 08/18/2003 secondary to right hemiparesis from a CVA. The patient deteriorated with several CVAs and had became encephalopathic requiring a ventilator-dependency with respiratory failure. The patient also had neuromuscular dysfunction. After extended period of time, per the patient's family request and requested by the ICU staff, decision to place a feeding tube was decided and scheduled for today.INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient was found to have esophagitis as well as gastritis via EGD and was placed on Prevacid granules.PROCEDURE: After informed written consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family. First, the EGD was to be performed.The Olympus endoscope was inserted through the mouth, oropharynx and into the esophagus. Esophagitis was noted. The scope was then passed through the esophagus into the stomach. The cardia, fundus, body, and antrum of the stomach were visualized. There was evidence of gastritis. The scope was passed into the duodenal bulb and sweep via the pylorus and then removed from the duodenum retroflexing on itself in the stomach looking at the hiatus. Next, attention was made to transilluminating the anterior abdominal wall for the PEG placement. The skin was then anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. The finder needle was then inserted under direct visualization. The catheter was then grasped via the endoscope and the wire was pulled back up through the patient's mouth. The Ponsky PEG tube was attached to the wire. A skin nick was made with a #11 blade scalpel. The wire was pulled back up through the abdominal wall point and Ponsky PEG back up through the abdominal wall and inserted into position. The endoscope was then replaced confirming position. Photograph was taken. The Ponsky PEG tube was trimmed and the desired attachments were placed and the patient did tolerate the procedure well. We will begin tube feeds later this afternoon."

Alkaline reflux gastritis.4. Gastroparesis.5. Probable Billroth II anastomosis.6. Status post Whipple's pancreaticoduodenectomy.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 55-year-old African-American female who had undergone Whipple's procedure approximately five to six years ago for a benign pancreatic mass. The patient has pancreatic insufficiency and is already on replacement. She is currently using Nexium. She has continued postprandial dyspepsia and reflux symptoms. To evaluate this, the patient was boarded for EGD. The patient gave informed consent for the procedure.GROSS FINDINGS: At the time of EGD, the patient was found to have alkaline reflux gastritis. There was no evidence of distal esophagitis. Gastroparesis was seen as there was retained fluid in the small intestine. The patient had no evidence of anastomotic obstruction and appeared to have a Billroth II reconstruction by gastric jejunostomy. Biopsies were taken and further recommendations will follow.PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the Endoscopy Suite. The heart and lungs examination were unremarkable. The vital signs were monitored and found to be stable throughout the procedure. The patient's oropharynx was anesthetized with Cetacaine spray. She was placed in left lateral position. The patient had the video Olympus GIF gastroscope model inserted per os and was advanced without difficulty through the hypopharynx. GE junction was in normal position. There was no evidence of any hiatal hernia. There was no evidence of distal esophagitis. The gastric remnant was entered. It was noted to be inflamed with alkaline reflux gastritis. The anastomosis was open and patent. The small intestine was entered. There was retained fluid material in the stomach and small intestine and _______ gastroparesis. Biopsies were performed. Insufflated air was removed with withdrawal of the scope. The patient's diet will be adjusted to postgastrectomy-type diet. Biopsies performed. Diet will be reviewed. The patient will have an upper GI series performed to rule out more distal type obstruction explaining the retained fluid versus gastroparesis. Reglan will also be added. Further recommendations will follow."
138,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with gastric biopsies.INDICATION: Abdominal pain.FINDINGS: Antral erythema; 2 cm polypoid pyloric channel tissue, questionable inflammatory polyp which was biopsied; duodenal erythema and erosion.MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl 200 mcg and versed 6 mg.SCOPE: GIF-Q180.PROCEDURE DETAIL: Following the preprocedure patient assessment the procedure, goals, risks including bleeding, perforation and side effects of medications and alternatives were reviewed. Questions were answered. Pause preprocedure was performed.Following titrated intravenous sedation the flexible video endoscope was introduced into the esophagus and advanced to the second portion of the duodenum without difficulty. The esophagus appeared to have normal motility and mucosa. Regular Z line was located at 44 cm from incisors. No erosion or ulceration. No esophagitis.Upon entering the stomach gastric mucosa was examined in detail including retroflexed views of cardia and fundus. There was pyloric channel and antral erythema, but no visible erosion or ulceration. There was a 2 cm polypoid pyloric channel tissue which was suspicious for inflammatory polyp. This was biopsied and was placed separately in bottle #2. Random gastric biopsies from antrum, incisura and body were obtained and placed in separate jar, bottle #1. No active ulceration was found.Upon entering the duodenal bulb there was extensive erythema and mild erosions, less than 3 mm in length, in first portion of duodenum, duodenal bulb and junction of first and second part of the duodenum. Postbulbar duodenum looked normal.The patient was assessed upon completion of the procedure. Okay to discharge once criteria met.Follow up with primary care physician.I met with patient afterward and discussed with him avoiding any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication. Await biopsy results."
139,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Refractory dyspepsia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:1. Hiatal hernia.2. Reflux esophagitis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with pseudo and esophageal biopsy.ANESTHESIA: Conscious sedation with Demerol and Versed.SPECIMEN: Esophageal biopsy.COMPLICATIONS: None.HISTORY: The patient is a 52-year-old female morbidly obese black female who has a long history of reflux and GERD type symptoms including complications such as hoarseness and chronic cough. She has been on multiple medical regimens and continues with dyspeptic symptoms.PROCEDURE: After proper informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite. She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation. When adequate level of sedation achieved, the gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and the esophagus was easily intubated. At the GE junction, a hiatal hernia was present. There were mild inflammatory changes consistent with reflux esophagitis. The scope was then passed into the stomach. It was insufflated and the scope was coursed along the greater curvature to the antrum. The pylorus was patent. There was evidence of bile reflux in the antrum. The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined and were without evidence of mass, ulceration, or inflammation. The scope was then brought back into the antrum.A retroflexion was attempted multiple times, however, the patient was having difficulty holding the air and adequate retroflexion view was not visualized. The gastroscope was then slowly withdrawn. There were no other abnormalities noted in the fundus or body. Once again at the GE junction, esophageal biopsy was taken. The scope was then completely withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. She will return to the General Medical Floor. We will continue b.i.d proton-pump inhibitor therapy as well as dietary restrictions. She should also attempt significant weight loss."
140,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal foreign body.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal foreign body, US penny.PROCEDURE: Esophagoscopy with foreign body removal.ANESTHESIA: General.INDICATIONS: The patient is a 17-month-old baby girl with biliary atresia, who had a delayed diagnosis and a late attempted Kasai portoenterostomy, which failed. The patient has progressive cholestatic jaundice and is on the liver transplant list at ABCD. The patient is fed by mouth and also with nasogastric enteral feeding supplements. She has had an __________ cough and relatively disinterested in oral intake for the past month. She was recently in the GI Clinic and an x-ray was ordered to check her tube placement and an incidental finding of a coin in the proximal esophagus was noted. Based on the history, it is quite possible this coin has been there close to a month. She is brought to the operating room now for attempted removal. I met with the parents and talked to them at length about the procedure and the increased risk in a child with a coin that has been in for a prolonged period of time. Hopefully, there will be no coin migration or significant irrigation that would require prolonged hospitalization.OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient had a penny lodged in the proximal esophagus in the typical location. There was no evidence of external migration and surrounding irritation was noted, but did not appear to be excessive. The coin actually came out with relative ease after which endoscopically identified.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient came to the operating room and had induction of general anesthesia. She was slow to respond to the usual propofol and other inducing agents and may be has some difficulty with tolerance or __________ tolerance to these medications. After her endotracheal tube was placed and securely taped to the left side of her mouth, I positioned the patient with a prominent shoulder roll and neck hyperextension and then used the laryngoscope to elevate the tiny glottic mechanism. A rigid esophagoscope was then inserted into the proximal esophagus, and the scope was gradually advanced with the lumen directly in frontal view. This was facilitated by the nasoenteric feeding tube that was in place, which I followed carefully until the edge of the coin could be seen. At this location, there was quite a bit of surrounding mucosal inflammation, but the coin edge could be clearly seen and was secured with the coin grasping forceps. I then withdrew the scope, forceps, and the coin as one unit, and it was easily retrieved. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no intraoperative complications. There was only one single coin noted, and she was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition."
141,Gastroenterology,"PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal foreign body, no associated comorbidities are noted.PROCEDURE: Esophagoscopy with removal of foreign body.CPT CODE: 43215.PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal foreign body, ICD-9 code 935.1.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Under general anesthesia, flexible EGD was performed. Esophagus was visualized. The quarter was visualized at the aortic knob, was removed with grasper. Estimated blood loss 0. Intravenous fluids during time of procedure 100 mL. No tissues. No complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Dr. X Pipkin attending pediatric surgeon was present throughout the entire procedure. The patient was transferred from OR to PACU in stable condition."
142,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Leaking anastomosis from esophagogastrectomy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Leaking anastomosis from esophagogastrectomy. PROCEDURE: Exploratory laparotomy and drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses with control of leakage. COMPLICATIONS: None. ANESTHESIA: General oroendotracheal intubation. PROCEDURE: After adequate general anesthesia was administered, the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped aseptically. Sutures and staples were removed. The abdomen was opened. The were some very early stage adhesions that were easy to separate. Dissection was carried up toward the upper abdomen where the patient was found to have a stool filled descended colon. This was retracted caudally to expose the stomach. There were a number of adhesions to the stomach. These were carefully dissected to expose initially the closure over the gastrotomy site. Initially this looked like this was leaking but it was actually found to be intact. The pyloroplasty was identified and also found to be intact with no evidence of leakage. Further dissection up toward the hiatus revealed an abscess collection. This was sent for culture and sensitivity and was aspirated and lavaged. Cavity tracked up toward the hiatus. Stomach itself appeared viable, there was no necrotic sections. Upper apex of the stomach was felt to be viable also. I did not pull the stomach and esophagus down into the abdomen from the mediastinum, but placed a sucker up into the mediastinum where additional turbid fluid was identified. Carefully placed a 10 mm flat Jackson-Pratt drain into the mediastinum through the hiatus to control this area of leakage. Two additional Jackson-Pratt drains were placed essentially through the gastrohepatic omentum. This was the area that most of the drainage had collected in. As I had previously discussed with Dr. Sageman I did not feel that mobilizing the stomach to redo the anastomosis in the chest would be a recoverable situation for the patient. I therefore did not push to visualize any focal areas of the anastomosis with the intent of repair. Once the drains were secured, they were brought out through the anterior abdominal wall and secured with 3-0 silk sutures and secured to bulb suction. The midline fascia was then closed using running #2 Prolene sutures bolstered with retention sutures. Subcutaneous tissue was copiously lavaged and then the skin was closed with loosely approximated staples. Dry gauze dressing was placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well, there were no complications."
143,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: History of perforated sigmoid diverticuli with Hartmann's procedure.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. History of perforated sigmoid diverticuli with Hartmann's procedure.2. Massive adhesions.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:1. Exploratory laparotomy.2. Lysis of adhesions and removal.3. Reversal of Hartmann's colostomy.4. Flexible sigmoidoscopy.5. Cystoscopy with left ureteral stent.ANESTHESIA: General.HISTORY: This is a 55-year-old gentleman who had a previous perforated diverticula. Recommendation for reversal of the colostomy was made after more than six months from the previous surgery for a sigmoid colon resection and Hartmann's colostomy.PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room placed into lithotomy position after being prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A cystoscope was introduced into the patient's urethra and to the bladder. Immediately, no evidence of cystitis was seen and the scope was introduced superiorly, measuring the bladder and immediately a #5 French ____ was introduced within the left urethra. The cystoscope was removed, a Foley was placed, and wide connection was placed attaching the left ureteral stent and Foley. At this point, immediately the patient was re-prepped and draped and immediately after the ostomy was closed with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, immediately at this point, the abdominal wall was opened with a #10 blade Bard-Parker down with electrocautery for complete hemostasis through the midline.The incision scar was cephalad due to the severe adhesions in the midline. Once the abdomen was entered in the epigastric area, then massive lysis of adhesions was performed to separate the small bowel from the anterior abdominal wall. Once the small bowel was completely free from the anterior abdominal wall, at this point, the ostomy was taken down with an elliptical incision with cautery and then meticulous dissection with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery down to the anterior abdominal wall, where a meticulous dissection was carried with Metzenbaum scissors to separate the entire ostomy from the abdominal wall. Immediately at this point, the bowel was dropped within the abdominal cavity, and more lysis of adhesions was performed cleaning the left gutter area to mobilize the colon further down to have no tension in the anastomosis. At this point, the rectal stump, where two previous sutures with Prolene were seen, were brought with hemostats. The rectal stump was free in a 360 degree fashion and immediately at this point, a decision to perform the anastomosis was made. First, a self-retaining retractor was introduced in the abdominal cavity and a bladder blade was introduced as well. Blue towel was placed above the small bowel retracting the bowel to cephalad and at this point, immediately the rectal stump was well visualized, no evidence of bleeding was seen, and the towels were placed along the edges of the abdominal wound. Immediately, the pursestring device was fired approximately 1 inch from the skin and on the descending colon, this was fired. The remainder of the excess tissue was closed with Metzenbaum scissors and immediately after dilating #25 and #29 mushroom tip from the T8 Ethicon was placed within the colon and then #9-0 suture was tied. Immediately from the anus, the dilator #25 and #29 was introduced dilating the rectum. The #29 EEA was introduced all the way anteriorly to the staple line and this spike from the EEA was used to perforate the rectum and then the mushroom from the descending colon was attached to it. The EEA was then fired. Once it was fired and was removed, the pelvis was filled with fluid. Immediately both doughnuts were ____ from the anastomosis. A Doyen was placed in both the anastomosis. Colonoscope was introduced. No bubble or air was seen coming from the anastomosis. There was no evidence of bleeding. Pictures of the anastomosis were taken. The scope then was removed from the patient's rectum. Copious amount of irrigation was used within the peritoneal cavity. Immediately at this point, all complete sponge and instrument count was performed. First, the ostomy site was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl suture. The peritoneum was closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture. Then, the midline incision was closed with a loop PDS in cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad tight in the middle. Subq tissue was copiously irrigated and the staples on the skin.The iodoform packing was placed within the old ostomy site and then the staples on the skin as well. The patient did tolerate the procedure well and will be followed during the hospitalization. The left ureteral stent was removed at the end of the procedure. _____ were performed. Lysis of adhesions were performed. Reversal of colostomy and EEA anastomosis #29 Ethicon."
144,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Colovesical fistula.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Colovesical fistula.2. Intraperitoneal abscess.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:1. Exploratory laparotomy.2. Low anterior colon resection.3. Flexible colonoscopy.4. Transverse loop colostomy and JP placement.ANESTHESIA: General.HISTORY: This 74-year-old female who had a recent hip fracture and the patient was in rehab when she started having some stool coming out of the urethra. The patient had retrograde cystogram, which revealed colovesical fistula. Recommendation for a surgery was made. The patient was explained the risks and benefits as well as the two sons and the daughter. They understood that the patient can even die from this procedure. All the three procedures were explained, without a colostomy, with Hartmann's colostomy, and with a transverse loop colostomy, and out of the three procedures, the patient's requested to have the loop colostomy and stated that the Hartmann's colostomy leaving the anastomosis with the risk of leaking.PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient was taken to the operating room, prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and was given general anesthetic. An incision was performed in the midline below the umbilicus to the pubis with a #10 blade Bard Parker. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis down to the fascia. The fascia was grasped with Ochsner's and then immediately the peritoneum was entered and the incision was carried cephalad and caudad with electrocautery.Once within the peritoneum, adhesiolysis was performed to separate the small bowel from the attachment of the anterior abdominal wall. At this point, immediately a small bowel was retracted cephalad. The patient was taken to a slightly Trendelenburg position and the descending colon was seen. The white line of Toldt was opened all the way down to the area of inflammation. At this point, meticulous dissection was carried to separate the small bowel from the attachment to the abscess. When the small bowel was completely freed of abscess, bulk of the bladder was seen anteriorly to the uterus. The abscess was cultured and sent it back to Bacteriology Department and immediately the opening into the bladder was visualized. At this point, the entire sigmoid colon was separated posteriorly as well as laterally and it was all the way down to sigmoid down to the rectum. At this point, decision to place a moist towel and retract old intestine superiorly as well as to place first self-retaining retractor in the abdominal cavity with a bladder blade was placed. Immediately, a GIA was fired right across the descending colon and sigmoid colon junction and then with peons within the mesentery were placed all the way down to the rectosigmoid junction where a TA-55 balloon Roticulator was fired. The specimen was cut with #10 blade Bard-Parker and sent it to Pathology. Immediately copious amount of irrigation was used and the staple line in the descending colon was brought with Allis. A pursestring device was fired. The staple line was cut. The dilators were used using #25 and #29, then _________ #29 EEA was placed and the suture was tied. At this point, attention was directed down to the rectal stump where dilators #25 and #29 were passed from the anus into the rectum and then the #29 Ethicon GIA was introduced. The spike came posteriorly through the staple line to avoid the inflammatory process anteriorly that was present in the area of the cul-de-sac as well as the uterine was present in this patient. Immediately, the EEA was connected with a mushroom. It was tied, fired, and a Doyen was placed above the anastomosis approximately four inches. Fluid was placed within the _________ and immediately a colonoscope was introduced from the patient's anus insufflating air. No air was seen evolving from the staple line. All fluid was removed and pictures of the staple line were taken. The scope was removed at this point. The case was passed to Dr. X for repair of the vesicle fistula. Dr. X did repair down the perforation of the bladder that was communicating with an abscess secondary to the perforated diverticulitis and the colon. After this was performed, copious amount of irrigation was used again. More lysis of adhesions were performed and decision to make a loop transverse colostomy was made to protect the anastomosis in a phase of a severe inflammatory process in the pelvis in the infected area. The incision was performed in the right upper quadrant.This incision was performed with cutting in the cautery, down into the fascia splitting the muscle and then the Penrose was passed under transverse colon, and was grasped on pulling the transverse colon at the level of the skin. The wire was passed under the transverse colon. It was left in place. Moderate irrigation was used in the peritoneal cavity and in the right lower quadrant, a JP was placed in the pelvis posteriorly to the abscess cavity that was down on the pelvis. At this point, immediately, yellow fluid was removed from the peritoneal cavity and the abdomen was closed with cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad with a loop PDS suture and then tied. Electrocautery for hemostasis and the subcutaneous tissue. Copious amount of irrigation was used. The skin was approximated with staples. At this point, immediately, the wound was covered with a moist towel and decision to mature the loop colostomy was made. The colostomy was opened longitudinally and then matured with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture through the skin edge. One it was completely matured, immediately the index finger was probed proximally and distally and both loops were completely opened. As previously mentioned, the Penrose was removed and the Bard was secured with a #3-0 nylon suture. The JP was secured with #3-0 nylon suture as well. At this point, dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The stent from the left ureter was removed and the Foley was left in place. The patient did tolerate the procedure well and will be followed up during the hospitalization."
145,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:1. Acute bowel obstruction.2. Umbilical hernia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:1. Acute small bowel obstruction.2. Incarcerated umbilical Hernia.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:1. Exploratory laparotomy.2. Release of small bowel obstruction.3. Repair of periumbilical hernia.ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation.COMPLICATIONS: None.DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition.SPECIMEN: Hernia sac.HISTORY: The patient is a 98-year-old female who presents from nursing home extended care facility with an incarcerated umbilical hernia, intractable nausea and vomiting and a bowel obstruction. Upon seeing the patient and discussing in extent with the family, it was decided the patient needed to go to the operating room for this nonreducible umbilical hernia and bowel obstruction and the family agreed with surgery.INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient was found to have an incarcerated umbilical hernia. There was a loop of small bowel incarcerated within the hernia sac. It showed signs of ecchymosis, however no signs of any ischemia or necrosis. It was easily reduced once opening the abdomen and the rest of the small bowel was ran without any other defects or abnormalities.PROCEDURE: After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family. The patient was brought to the operating suite. After general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion. A midline incision was made around the umbilical hernia defect with a #10 blade scalpel. Dissection was then carried down to the fascia. Using a sharp dissection, an incision was made above the defect superior to the defect entering the fascia. The abdomen was entered under direct visualization. The small bowel that was entrapped within the hernia sac was easily reduced and observed and appeared to be ecchymotic, however, no signs of ischemia were noted or necrosis. The remaining of the fascia was then extended using Metzenbaum scissors. The hernia sac was removed using Mayo scissors and sent off as specimen. Next, the bowel was run from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve with no evidence of any other abnormalities. The small bowel was then milked down removing all the fluid. The bowel was decompressed distal to the obstruction. Once returning the abdominal contents to the abdomen, attention was next made in closing the abdomen and using #1 Vicryl suture in the figure-of-eight fashion the fascia was closed. The umbilicus was then reapproximated to its anatomical position with a #1 Vicryl suture. A #3-0 Vicryl suture was then used to reapproximate the deep dermal layers and skin staples were used on the skin. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition."
146,Gastroenterology,"MEDICATIONS: None.DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and the Olympus video colonoscope was inserted through the anus and advanced in retrograde fashion for a distance of *** cm to the proximal descending colon and then slowly withdrawn. The mucosa appeared normal. Retroflex examination of the rectum was normal."
147,Gastroenterology,"INDICATION: Rectal bleeding.PREMEDICATION: See procedure nurse NCS form.PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was placed in the left lateral position. Digital rectal exam was performed revealing normal sphincter tone and no external hemorrhoids. A Pentax video endoscope was then inserted into rectum. The quality of the preparation was good. Under direct visualization, the endoscope was advanced to 60 cm from the anus without difficulty, and then slowly withdrawn, with careful examination of the colonic mucosa.The mucosa was normal with the normal vascular pattern and no granularity, friability, or ulceration. There was no evidence of other polyps, masses, diverticula, or angiodysplasia. Retroflexion was performed in the rectum, and there were a few small white patches just at the anal verge. These were biopsied to rule out any abnormality and also internal hemorrhoids were noted. The colonoscope was then removed and the procedure was terminated.The endoscope was removed and the procedure terminated. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.IMPRESSION: 1. White plaques at the anal verge, biopsied to rule out abnormality.2. Internal hemorrhoids, otherwise normal flexible sigmoidoscopy.PLAN: Continue fiber supplement as well as hyoscyamine. Await laboratory results. I will see her back in July 2005 when I return from maternity leave. If she has any problems during the interval when I am gone, she will follow up with any other physicians here in the office."
148,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Following a barium enema prep and lidocaine ointment to the rectal vault, perirectal inspection and rectal exam were normal. The Olympus video colonoscope then introduced into the rectum and passed by directed vision to the distal descending colon. Withdrawal notes an otherwise normal descending, rectosigmoid and rectum. Retroflexion noted no abnormality of the internal ring. No hemorrhoids were noted. Withdrawal from the patient terminated the procedure."
149,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Flexible sigmoidoscopy.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Rectal bleeding.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diverticulosis.MEDICATIONS: None.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The Olympus gastroscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon for a distance of 90 cm, reaching the proximal descending colon. At this point, stool occupied the lumen, preventing further passage. The colon distal to this was well cleaned out and easily visualized. The mucosa was normal throughout the regions examined. Numerous diverticula were seen. There was no blood or old blood or active bleeding. A retroflexed view of the anorectal junction showed no hemorrhoids. He tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.FINAL DIAGNOSES:1. Sigmoid and left colon diverticulosis.2. Otherwise normal flexible sigmoidoscopy to the proximal descending colon.3. The bleeding was most likely from a diverticulum, given the self limited but moderately severe quantity that he described.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Follow up with Dr. X as needed.2. If there is further bleeding, a full colonoscopy is recommended."

151,Gastroenterology,"REASON FOR VISIT: Followup of laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a delightful baby girl, who is now nearly 8 months of age and had a tracheostomy for subglottic stenosis. Laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy was done because of the need for enteral feeding access and to protect her airway at a time when it is either going to heal enough to improve and allow decannulation or eventually prove that she will need laryngotracheoplasty. Dr. X is following The patient for this and currently plans are to perform a repeat endoscopic exam every couple of months to assist the status of her airway caliber.The patient had a laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy on 10/05/2007. She has done well since that time. She has had some episodes of retching intermittently and these seemed to be unpredictable. She also had some diarrhea and poor feeding tolerance about a week ago but that has also resolved. The patient currently takes about 1 ounce to 1.5 ounce of her feedings by mouth and the rest is given by G-tube. She seems otherwise happy and is not having an excessive amount of stools. Her parents have not noted any significant problems with the gastrostomy site.The patient's exam today is excellent. Her belly is soft and nontender. All of her laparoscopic trocar sites are healing with a normal amount of induration, but there is no evidence of hernia or infection. We removed The patient's gastrostomy button today and showed her parents how to reinsert one without difficulty. The site of the gastrostomy is excellent. There is not even a hint of granulation tissue or erythema, and I am very happy with the overall appearance.IMPRESSION: The patient is doing exceptionally well status post laparoscope fundoplication and gastrostomy. Hopefully, the exquisite control of acid reflux by fundoplication will help her airway heal, and if she does well, allow decannulation in the future. If she does require laryngotracheoplasty, the protection from acid reflux will be important to healing of that procedure as well.PLAN: The patient will follow up as needed for problems related to gastrostomy. We will see her when she comes in the hospital for endoscopic exams and possibly laryngotracheoplasty in the future."

157,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Dysphagia and esophageal spasm.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Esophagitis and esophageal stricture.PROCEDURE: Gastroscopy.MEDICATIONS: MAC.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The Olympus gastroscope was introduced into the oropharynx and passed carefully through the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, to the third portion of the duodenum. The hypopharynx was normal and the upper esophageal sphincter was unremarkable. The esophageal contour was normal, with the gastroesophageal junction located at 38 cm from the incisors. At this point, there were several linear erosions and a sense of stricturing at 38 cm. Below this, there was a small hiatal hernia with the hiatus noted at 42 cm from the incisors. The mucosa within the hernia was normal. The gastric lumen was normal with normal mucosa throughout. The pylorus was patent permitting passage of the scope into the duodenum, which was normal through the third portion. During withdrawal of the scope, additional views were obtained of the cardia, confirming the presence of a small hiatal hernia. It was decided to attempt dilation of the strictured area, so an 18-mm TTS balloon was placed across the stricture and inflated to the recommended diameter. When the balloon was fully inflated, the lumen appeared to be larger than 18 mm diameter, suggesting that the stricture was in fact not a significant one. No stretching of the mucosa took place. The balloon was deflated and the scope was withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.FINAL DIAGNOSES:1. Esophagitis.2. Minor stricture at the gastroesophageal junction.3. Hiatal hernia.4. Otherwise normal upper endoscopy to the transverse duodenum.RECOMMENDATIONS: Continue proton pump inhibitor therapy."
158,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Gastroscopy.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Dysphagia, possible stricture.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gastroparesis.MEDICATION: MAC.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The Olympus gastroscope was introduced into the hypopharynx and passed carefully through the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The hypopharynx was normal. The esophagus had a normal upper esophageal sphincter, normal contour throughout, and a normal gastroesophageal junction viewed at 39 cm from the incisors. There was no evidence of stricturing or extrinsic narrowing from her previous hiatal hernia repair. There was no sign of reflux esophagitis. On entering the gastric lumen, a large bezoar of undigested food was seen occupying much of the gastric fundus and body. It had 2 to 3 mm diameter. This was broken up using a scope into smaller pieces. There was no retained gastric liquid. The antrum appeared normal and the pylorus was patent. The scope passed easily into the duodenum, which was normal through the second portion. On withdrawal of the scope, additional views of the cardia were obtained, and there was no evidence of any tumor or narrowing. The scope was withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.FINAL DIAGNOSES:1. Normal postoperative hernia repair.2. Retained gastric contents forming a partial bezoar, suggestive of gastroparesis.3. Otherwise normal upper endoscopy to the descending duodenum.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Continue proton pump inhibitors.2. Use Reglan 10 mg three to four times a day."
159,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Gastroscopy.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Dysphagia and globus.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Normal.MEDICATIONS: MAC.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The Olympus gastroscope was introduced through the oropharynx and passed carefully through the esophagus and stomach, and then through the gastrojejunal anastomosis into the efferent jejunal loop. The preparation was good and all surfaces were well seen. The hypopharynx was normal with no evidence of inflammation. The esophagus had a normal contour and normal mucosa throughout with no sign of stricturing or inflammation or exudate. The GE junction was located at 39 cm from the incisors and appeared normal with no evidence of reflux, damage, or Barrett's. Below this there was a small gastric pouch measuring 6 cm with intact mucosa and no retained food. The gastrojejunal anastomosis was patent measuring about 12 mm, with no inflammation or ulceration. Beyond this there was a side-to-side gastrojejunal anastomosis with a short afferent blind end and a normal efferent end with no sign of obstruction or inflammation. The scope was withdrawn and the patient was sent to recovery room. She tolerated the procedure well.FINAL DIAGNOSES:1. Normal post-gastric bypass anatomy.2. No evidence of inflammation or narrowing to explain her symptoms."
160,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Gastroscopy.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gastroesophageal reflux disease.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Barrett esophagus.MEDICATIONS: MAC.PROCEDURE: The Olympus gastroscope was introduced into the oropharynx and passed carefully through the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to the transverse duodenum. The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen. The hypopharynx appeared normal. The esophagus had a normal contour and normal mucosa throughout its distance, but at the distal end, there was a moderate-sized hiatal hernia noted. The GE junction was seen at 40 cm and the hiatus was noted at 44 cm from the incisors. Above the GE junction, there were three fingers of columnar epithelium extending cephalad, to a distance of about 2 cm. This appears to be consistent with Barrett esophagus. Multiple biopsies were taken from numerous areas in this region. There was no active ulceration or inflammation and no stricture. The hiatal hernia sac had normal mucosa except for one small erosion at the hiatus. The gastric body had normal mucosa throughout. Numerous small fundic gland polyps were noted, measuring 3 to 5 mm in size with an entirely benign appearance. Biopsies were taken from the antrum to rule out Helicobacter pylori. A retroflex view of the cardia and fundus confirmed the small hiatal hernia and demonstrated no additional lesions. The scope was passed through the pylorus, which was patent and normal. The mucosa throughout the duodenum in the first, second, and third portions was entirely normal. The scope was withdrawn and the patient was sent to the recovery room. He tolerated the procedure well.FINAL DIAGNOSES:1. A short-segment Barrett esophagus.2. Hiatal hernia.3. Incidental fundic gland polyps in the gastric body.4. Otherwise, normal upper endoscopy to the transverse duodenum.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Follow up biopsy report.2. Continue PPI therapy.3. Follow up with Dr. X as needed.4. Surveillance endoscopy for Barrett in 3 years (if pathology confirms this diagnosis)."
161,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Feeding disorder.2. Down syndrome.3. Congenital heart disease.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Feeding disorder.2. Down syndrome.3. Congenital heart disease.OPERATION PERFORMED: Gastrostomy.ANESTHESIA: General.INDICATIONS: This 6-week-old female infant had been transferred to Children's Hospital because of Down syndrome and congenital heart disease. She has not been able to feed well and in fact has to now be NG tube fed. Her swallowing mechanism does not appear to be very functional, and therefore, it was felt that in order to aid in her home care that she would be better served with a gastrostomy.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: After the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in usual manner. Transverse left upper quadrant incision was made and carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection. The muscle was divided and the peritoneal cavity entered. The greater curvature of the stomach was grasped with a Babcock clamp and brought into the operative field. The site for gastrostomy was selected and a pursestring suture of #4-0 Nurolon placed in the gastric wall. A 14-French 0.8 cm Mic-Key tubeless gastrostomy button was then placed into the stomach and the pursestring secured about the tube. Following this, the stomach was returned to the abdominal cavity and the posterior fascia was closed using a #4-0 Nurolon affixing the stomach to the posterior fascia. The anterior fascia was then closed with #3-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue with the same, and the skin closed with #5-0 subcuticular Monocryl. The balloon was inflated to the full 5 mL. A sterile dressing was then applied and the child awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."

163,Gastroenterology,"PROBLEM: Rectal bleeding, positive celiac sprue panel.HISTORY: The patient is a 19-year-old Irish-Greek female who ever since elementary school has noted diarrhea, constipation, cramping, nausea, vomiting, bloating, belching, abdominal discomfort, change in bowel habits. She noted that her symptoms were getting increasingly worse and so she went for evaluation and was finally tested for celiac sprue and found to have a positive tissue transglutaminase as well as antiendomysial antibody. She has been on a gluten-free diet for approximately one week now and her symptoms are remarkably improved. She actually has none of these symptoms since starting her gluten-free diet. She has noted intermittent rectal bleeding with constipation, on the toilet tissue. She feels remarkably better after starting a gluten-free diet.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.OPERATIONS: She is status post a tonsillectomy as well as ear tubes.ILLNESSES: Questionable kidney stone.MEDICATIONS: None.HABITS: No tobacco. No ethanol.SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives by herself. She currently works in a dental office.FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for a mother who is in good health, a father who has joint problems and questionable celiac disease as well. She has two sisters and one brother. One sister interestingly has inflammatory arthritis.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Notable for fever, fatigue, blurred vision, rash and itching; her GI symptoms that were discussed in the HPI are actually resolved in that she started the gluten-free diet. She also notes headaches, anxiety, heat and cold intolerance, excessive thirst and urination. Please see symptoms summary sheet dated April 18, 2005.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: She is a well-developed pleasant 19 female. She has a blood pressure of 120/80, a pulse of 70, she weighs 170 pounds. She has anicteric sclerae. Pink conjunctivae. PERRLA. ENT: MMM. NECK: Supple. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. ABDOMEN: Soft, nondistended and nontender. Good bowel sounds. RECTAL: She has no external hemorrhoids and no probable internal hemorrhoids on exam. LYMPH: No cervical lymphadenopathy. EXTREMITIES: No edema. No rash. NEURO/PSYCH: Orientation, memory, motor and gait are intact.IMPRESSION/PLAN: The patient is a 19-year-old female with what appears to be celiac sprue, that is markedly improved on a gluten-free diet. I discussed with her and her mother that the gold standard really is a small bowel biopsy, but she would have to go back on her gluten diet to obtain the study. At this point in time, she does not seem to be quite interested in that as she feels to be markedly better for the first time in many years. I have given her a handout regarding celiac disease as well as a gluten-free diet and we will go ahead and obtain a small bowel follow through as it seems as if she has had symptoms for many years. We will check a TSH as well as a CBC to make sure she is not anemic and secondary to the rectal bleeding and a sister with inflammatory arthritis, we will go ahead and check a flexible sigmoidoscopy to make sure there are no signs of inflammatory bowel disease."
164,Gastroenterology,"PROBLEM: Chronic abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abnormal liver function tests.HISTORY: The patient is a 23-year-old female referred for evaluation due to a chronic history of abdominal pain and extensive work-up for abnormal liver function tests and this chronic nausea and vomiting referred here for further evaluation due to the patient's recent move from Eugene to Portland. The patient is not a great historian. Most of the history is obtained through the old history and chart that the patient has with her. According to what we can make out, she began experiencing nausea, vomiting, recurrent epigastric and right upper quadrant pain in 2001. She was initially seen by Dr. A back in September 2001 for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. During those times, it was suspected that part of her symptoms may be secondary to biliary disease and underwent a cholecystectomy performed in Oregon by Dr. A in August 2001. It was assumed that this was caused by biliary dyskinesia. Previous to that, an upper endoscopy was performed by Dr. B in July 2001 that showed to be mild gastritis secondary to anti-inflammatory use. Postoperatively she continued to have nausea and vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain and epigastric pain similar to her gallbladder pain in the past. In addition, she had significant abnormal liver function tests with ALT in the 600's, AST 300's with a bilirubin 2.5 and alkaline phosphatase in the 200's. Ultrasound shows common bile duct of 6 mm post cholecystectomy. The patient was then eventually referred to Dr. W in Oregon. Given the abnormal liver function tests and abnormal ultrasound, Dr. W performed an ERCP with sphincterotomy in September 20, 2001. Because of the symptoms and the suspicions of Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, a sphincterotomy was performed during the ERCP. Procedure was uneventful. The patient did well for a few months, but unfortunately got hospitalized again in May 2002 for recurrence of the abdominal pain and markedly elevated liver function tests with ALT in the 600 to 900 range, again with nausea and vomiting. After transient elevation, her liver function tests would normalize. During her hospitalization, extensive work-up including CT scan, 24 hour urine collection for porphyrins, a percutaneous liver biopsy, and Hepatitis panel, all of which were normal. A repeat ERCP with placement of endobiliary stent was uneventful and did not show evidence of PBC or PSC. After placement of the biliary stent, according to Dr. W's note, it apparently helped the patient with her symptoms with decreased frequency of nausea, vomiting, and pain. MRI of the abdomen was also performed in May 2002 showing a horseshoe kidney, which was previously known on old CT scans. While the biliary stent was in place, the patient did have recurrent bouts of nausea and vomiting and pain rated 7 out of 10 in intensity. Finally in August 2002, the endobiliary stent was removed and there were no signs of obstruction. Thereafter, the patient actually did fairly well for about a year, but because of a recurrence of her symptoms, Dr. W actually sent the patient up to OHSU for evaluation of this continued fairly mysterious abdominal pain. The patient states that she saw Dr. A who recommended some laboratory tests and a repeat ERCP for further evaluation, but the patient did not want to go up to OHSU as she was somewhat unhappy with initial care. Then, over the course of the next several month, at the beginning of 2004, the patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and recurrence abdominal pain returned. In fact, recently as the last documentation in May and June, the patient visited Emergency Room several times due to her symptoms. Lab tests show normal CBC with no signs of elevated white count. AST and ALT were normal. Alkaline phosphatase was in the low 200's with minimally elevated lipase of 78. Bilirubin was completely normal. The patient was given some Zofran and that seemed to control her symptoms and then she was discharged and now referred to us for further evaluation. At the present time, the patient is not having any abdominal pain. She states she threw up three times in the morning and is feeling well at this point. Her abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting symptoms are random. It does not associate with food. It is not pre or post meal and occasionally will wake her up in the middle of the night. She has not lost any weight despite this chronic nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain. Her bowel habits have been fairly normal. No hematemesis or melena. No rashes, joint pain, or other symptoms have been noted. ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to Sulfa and Codeine. OPERATIONS: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, two ERCP's including stent placement and sphincterotomy.ILLNESSES: Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis for which Dr. B is following.MEDICATIONS: The patient is on some type of anti-inflammatory, for which the name is unknown to her. She is also taking some Zofran. HABITS: She does not drink or smoke. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patent moved up from Eugene. She currently lives up here and works in Portland. FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient has seen primarily Dr. B, her rheumatologist, as primary care.DATA: The patient's extensive chart was reviewed. It took over 45 minutes to sort through the chart and the labs. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a 23-year old female who appears well developed with no acute signs of distress. HENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, PERRLA, EOMI, sclerae are anicteric. Nares are patent and symmetrical. The oropharynx is clear with moist mucus membranes and no obvious mucosal lesions. The tongue is midline. NECK: Supple without adenopathy, JVD, or thyromegaly. There's no supraclavicular adenopathy. LUNGS: Clear bilaterally with normal respiratory effort. BACK: Nontender to palpation and there's no CVA tenderness or obvious spinal deformity. CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur. ABDOMEN: Soft, nondistended and nontender to palpation throughout with no appreciable hepatosplenomegaly, masses, fullness or ascites. Bowel sounds were present and did appear normal. RECTAL: Deferred. EXTREMITIES: Without edema, calf tenderness or joint swelling. NEUROLOGIC: Shows the patient to be alert and oriented x's 3 with normal gait. SKIN: Warm and dry with normal color and no rashes. IMPRESSION: A 23-year-old female with fairly mysterious symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain status post cholecystectomy and ERCP with sphincterotomy. She continues to have very intermittent elevated liver function tests and symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. There was some discussion with Dr. W in the past regarding extending the sphincterotomy to ensure that a complete sphincterotomy was performed if the patient should have sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, however, at this time I am reluctant to do so without further reviewing the patient's chart and investigating other avenues. I think we will check another repeat liver function test and I think it may be helpful to repeat a liver biopsy to ensure we are not missing other primary liver diseases before concentrating purely on the biliary tree itself. In addition, AMA will be obtained along with a liver function test. I would also like to obtain some discharge summaries from Dr. W's office to further clarify what has transpired over the past three years. PLAN: 1. Obtain discharge summaries from Dr. W's office.2. Send the patient for a complete metabolic panel, AMA.3. Send the patient for ultrasound and possible ultrasound guided liver biopsy.4. The patient will return to see me in three weeks. We will consider further options pending on these results of the test and review of the patient's discharge summaries from Dr. W's office. If the patient should show symptoms of pain and elevated liver function tests to be consistent with Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, we may repeat the ERCP and extend the sphincterotomy. The entire case was discussed with the patient. The patient is agreeable to the current plan. Thank you for this consultation. FOLLOWUP: In two to three weeks."
165,Gastroenterology,"PROBLEM: Prescription evaluation for Crohn's disease.HISTORY: This is a 46-year-old male who is here for a refill of Imuran. He is taking it at a dose of 100 mg per day. He is status post resection of the terminal ileum and has experienced intermittent obstructive symptoms for the past several years. In fact, he had an episode three weeks ago in which he was seen at the emergency room after experiencing sudden onset of abdominal pain and vomiting. An x-ray was performed, which showed no signs of obstruction per his report. He thinks that the inciting factor of this incident was too many grapes eaten the day before. He has had similar symptoms suggestive of obstruction when eating oranges or other high-residue fruits in the past. The patient's normal bowel pattern is loose stools and this is unchanged recently. He has not had any rectal bleeding. He asks today about a rope-like vein on his anterior right arm that has been a little tender and enlarged after he was in the emergency room and they had difficulty with IV insertion. He has not had any fever, red streaking up the arm, or enlargement of lymph nodes. The tenderness has now completely resolved. He had a colonoscopy performed in August of 2003, by Dr. S. An anastomotic stricture was found at the terminal ileum/cecum junction. Dr. S recommended that if the patient experienced crampy abdominal pain or other symptoms of obstruction, that he may consider balloon dilation. No active Crohn's disease was found during the colonoscopy. Earlier this year, he experienced a non-specific hepatitis with elevation of his liver function tests. At that time he was taking a lot of Tylenol for migraine-type headaches. Under Dr. S's recommendation, he stopped the Imuran for one month and reduced his dose of Tylenol. Since that time his liver enzymes have normalized and he has restarted the Imuran with no problems. He also reports heartburn that is occurring on a slightly more frequent basis than it has in the past. It used to occur once a week only, but has now increased in frequency to twice a week. He takes over-the-counter H2 blockers as needed, as well as Tums. He associates the onset of his symptoms with eating spicy Mexican food.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Reviewed and unchanged.ALLERGIES: No known allergies to medications.OPERATIONS: Unchanged.ILLNESSES: Crohn's disease, vitamin B12 deficiency.MEDICATIONS: Imuran, Nascobal, Vicodin p.r.n.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Dated 08/04/04 is reviewed and noted. Please see pertinent GI issues as discussed above. Otherwise unremarkable.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Pleasant male in no acute distress. Well nourished and well developed. SKIN: indurated, cord-like superficial vein on the right anterior forearm, approx. 3 cm in length. Non-tender to palpation. No erythema or red streaking. No edema. LYMPH: No epitrochlear or axillary lymph node enlargement or tenderness on the right side. DATA REVIEWED: Labs from June 8th and July 19th reviewed. Liver function tests normal with AST 14 and ALT 44. WBCs were slightly low at 4.8. Hemoglobin dropped slightly from 14.1 on 6/8 to 12.9 on 7/19. Hematocrit dropped slightly as well from 43.2 on 6/804 to 40.0 on 7/19/04. These results were reviewed by Dr. S and lab results letter sent.IMPRESSION: 1. Crohn's disease, status post terminal ileum resection, on Imuran. Intermittent symptoms of bowel obstruction. Last episode three weeks ago.2. History of non-specific hepatitis while taking high doses of Tylenol. Now resolved. 2. Increased frequency of reflux symptoms.3. Superficial thrombophlebitis, resolving. 4. Slightly low H&H.PLAN: 1. We discussed Dr. S's recommendation that the patient undergo balloon dilation for recurrent bowel obstruction type symptoms. The patient emphatically states that he does not want to consider dilation at this time. The patient is strongly encouraged to call us when he does experience any obstructive symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel habits. He states understanding of this. Advised to maintain low residue diet to avoid obstructions. 2. Continue with liver panel and ABC every month per Dr. S's instructions.3. Continue Imuran 100 mg per day.4. Continue to minimize Tylenol use. The patient is wondering if he can take another type of medication for migraines that is not Tylenol or antiinflammatories or aspirin. Dr. S is consulted and agrees that Imitrex is an acceptable alternative for migraine headaches since he does not have advanced liver disease. The patient will make an appointment with his primary care provider to discuss this further. 5. Reviewed the importance of prophylactic treatment of reflux-type symptoms. Encouraged the patient to take over-the-counter H2 blockers on a daily basis to prevent symptoms from occurring. The patient will try this and if he remains symptomatic, then he will call our office and a prescription for Zantac 150 mg per day will be provided. Reviewed the potential need for upper endoscopy should his symptoms continue or become more frequent. He does not want to undergo any type of procedure such as that at this time.6. His thrombophlebitis appears to be resolving and does not have any alarming features present. No treatment is needed at this time. He is instructed to call our office or his PCP if he experiences any pain, red streaking or fever. 7. We will watch his CBC carefully to ensure that the H&H does not continue to drop. If it does, then he may need further evaluation with iron studies, B12 levels, or a GI evaluation. FOLLOWUP: Continue liver panel and ABC every month; follow up pending these results. Call our office for obstructive symptoms or continued reflux. Otherwise prescription evaluation in one year."

167,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right colon tumor.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Right colon cancer.2. Ascites.3. Adhesions.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:1. Exploratory laparotomy.2. Lysis of adhesions.3. Right hemicolectomy.ANESTHESIA: General.COMPLICATIONS: None.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 200 cc.URINE OUTPUT: 200 cc.CRYSTALLOIDS GIVEN: 2700 cc.INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE: The patient is a 53-year-old African-American female who presented with near obstructing lesion at the hepatic flexure. The patient underwent a colonoscopy which found this lesion and biopsies were taken proving invasive adenocarcinoma. The patient was NG decompressed preoperatively and was prepared for surgery. The need for removal of the colon cancer was explained at length. The patient was agreeable to proceed with the surgery and signed preoperatively informed consent.PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the Operative Suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia per Anesthesia Department and NG and Foley catheters were placed preoperatively. She was given triple antibiotics IV. Due to her near obstructive symptoms, a formal ________ was not performed.The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A midline laparotomy incision was made with a #10 blade scalpel and subcutaneous tissues were separated with electrocautery down to the anterior abdominal fascia. Once divided, the intraabdominal cavity was accessed and bowel was protected as the rest of the abdominal wall was opened in the midline. Extensive fluid was seen upon entering the abdomen, ascites fluid, which was clear straw-colored and this was sampled for cytology. Next, the small bowel was retracted with digital exploration and there was a evidence of hepatic flexure, colonic mass, which was adherent to the surrounding tissues. With mobilization of the colon along the line of Toldt down to the right gutter, the entire ileocecal region up to the transverse colon was mobilized into the field. Next, a window was made 5 inches from the ileocecal valve and a GIA-75 was fired across the ileum. Next, a second GIA device was fired across the proximal transverse colon, just sparring the middle colic artery. The dissection was then carried down along the mesentry, down to the root of the mesentry. Several lymph nodes were sampled carefully, and small radiopaque clips were applied along the base of the mesentry. The mesentry vessels are hemostated and tied with #0-Vicryl suture sequentially, ligated in between. Once this specimen was submitted to pathology, the wound was inspected. There was no evidence of bleeding from any of the suture sites. Next, a side-by-side anastomosis was performed between the transverse colon and the terminal ileum. A third GIA-75 was fired side-by-side and GIA-55 was used to close the anastomosis. A patent anastomosis was palpated. The anastomosis was then protected with a #2-0 Vicryl #0-muscular suture. Next, the mesenteric root was closed with a running #0-Vicryl suture to prevent any chance of internal hernia. The suture sites were inspected and there was no evidence of leakage. Next, the intraabdominal cavity was thoroughly irrigated with sterile saline and the anastomosis was carried into the right lower gutter. Omentum was used to cover the intestines which appeared dilated and indurated from the near obstruction. Next, the abdominal wall was reapproximated and the fascial layer using a two running loop PDS sutures meeting in the middle with good approximation of both the abdominal fascia. Additional sterile saline was used to irrigate the subcutaneous fat and then the skin was closed with sequential sterile staples.Sterile dressing was applied and the skin was cleansed and the patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and extubated in the Operating Room and she was transferred to Recovery Room in stable condition and will be continued to be monitored on the Telemetry Floor with triple antibiotics and NG decompression."
168,Gastroenterology,"REASON FOR ADMISSION: Hepatic encephalopathy.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51-year-old Native American male with known alcohol cirrhosis who presented to the emergency room after an accidental fall in the bathroom. He said that he was doing fine prior to that and denied having any complaints. He was sitting watching TV and he felt sleepy. So, he went to the bathroom to urinate before going to bed and while he was trying to lift the seat, he tripped and fell and hit his head on the back. His head hit the toilet seat. Then, he started having bleeding and had pain in the area with headache. He did not lose consciousness as far as he can tell. He went and woke up his sister. This happened somewhere between 10:30 and 11 p.m. His sister brought a towel and covered the laceration on the back of his head and called EMS, who came to his house and brought him to the emergency room, where he was found to have a laceration on the back of his head, which was stapled and a CT of the head was obtained and ruled out any acute intracranial pathology. On his lab work, his ammonia was found to be markedly elevated at 106. So, he is being admitted for management of this. He denied having any abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, GI bleed, hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. He said he has been taking his medicines, but he could not recall those. He denied having any symptoms prior to this fall. He said earlier today he also fell. He also said that this was an accidental fall caused by problem with his walker. He landed on his back at that time, but did not have any back pain afterwards.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Liver cirrhosis caused by alcohol. This is per the patient.2. He thinks he is diabetic.3. History of intracranial hemorrhage. He said it was subdural hematoma. This was traumatic and happened seven years ago leaving him with the right-sided hemiparesis.4. He said he had a seizure back then, but he does not have seizures now.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:1. He has a surgery on his stomach as a child. He does not know the type.2. Surgery for a leg fracture.3. Craniotomy seven years ago for an intracranial hemorrhage/subdural hematoma.MEDICATIONS: He does not remember his medications except for the lactulose and multivitamins.ALLERGIES: Dilantin.SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives in Sacaton with his sister. He is separated from his wife who lives in Coolidge. He smokes one or two cigarettes a day. Denies drug abuse.

Film was reviewed. The report mentioned, status post frontal craniotomy and a small focus of encephalomalacia involving the left frontal lobe. This is likely consistent with residuals from his previous head injury. There is also mild generalized atrophy and changes consistent with chronic small vessel disease. No other findings on his CT. The skull is unremarkable except for the surgery changes. No acute abnormalities overall.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:1. Hepatic encephalopathy. Trigger is unclear at this time. Could be noncompliance. No evidence of GI bleed and his electrolytes are normal. I am not sure if he is taking any sedatives, as he does not recall the medication that he is on. The patient will be admitted to the hospital for management. He will be started on lactulose. I will give him 30 mL every two hours until he has a bowel movement. Then, we will adjust the dose to target three bowel movements daily and we will monitor his ammonia level and ensure that it is trending down. We will monitor his electrolyte and correct as needed and I will hydrate him, as hypovolemia is also a possible trigger. We will obtain an ultrasound of his abdomen to see if there is any ascites. At this time, there is no clinical evidence of SBP, but if he develops any fever may consider tapping his belly if there is ascites to rule out that possibility.2. Thrombocytopenia likely due to cirrhosis. We will monitor the level. No need for transfusion at this time.3. Macrocytosis also due to liver disease. I will check his vitamin levels, however, to ensure that he does not need any supplementation.4. History of diabetes as per the patient. His glucose is 105. This can be clarified in the morning with his primary care physician. We will monitor his glucose for now.5. Skull laceration. This was stapled by the ER physician and we will watch it for now, appear to be stable. No evidence of any other trauma.6. We will watch him on the telemetry floor to ensure that he has no arrhythmias leading to his two falls, which appear to be incidental as per the patient.7. Right-sided hemiparesis appear to be chronic and not an acute issue. The patient already has a walker at home.8. We can try to obtain more information in the morning about his past medical history, medication, etc., from his family and/or his primary care physician at Sacaton.Time spent in evaluation and management of this patient in the emergency room exceeds 70 minutes."
169,Gastroenterology,"NUCLEAR MEDICINE HEPATOBILIARY SCANREASON FOR EXAM: Right upper quadrant pain.COMPARISONS: CT of the abdomen dated 02/13/09 and ultrasound of the abdomen dated 02/13/09.Radiopharmaceutical 6.9 mCi of Technetium-99m Choletec.FINDINGS: Imaging obtained up to 30 minutes after the injection of radiopharmaceutical shows a normal hepatobiliary transfer time. There is normal accumulation within the gallbladder.After the injection of 2.1 mcg of intravenous cholecystic _______, the gallbladder ejection fraction at 30 minutes was calculated to be 32% (normal is greater than 35%). The patient experienced 2/10 pain at 5 minutes after the injection of the radiopharmaceutical and the patient also complained of nausea.IMPRESSION:1. Negative for acute cholecystitis or cystic duct obstruction.2. Gallbladder ejection fraction just under the lower limits of normal at 32% that can be seen with very mild chronic cholecystitis."
170,Gastroenterology,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Pneumatosis coli in the cecum.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman who was admitted on 10/27/07 with weakness and tiredness with aspiration pneumonia. The patient is very difficult to obtain information from; however, he appears to be having frequent nausea and vomiting with an aspiration pneumonia and abdominal discomfort. In addition, this hospitalization, he has undergone an upper endoscopy, which found a small ulcer after dropping his hematocrit and becoming anemic. He had a CT scan on Friday, 11/02/07, which apparently showed pneumatosis and his cecum worrisome for ischemic colitis as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple liver lesions, which could be metastatic disease versus cysts. In discussions with the patient, he had multiple bowel movements yesterday and is currently passing flatus and has epigastric pain.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Obtained from the medical chart. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia, osteoporosis, alcoholism, microcytic anemia.MEDICATIONS: Per his current medical chart.ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient had a long history of smoking but quit many years ago. He does have chronic alcohol use.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: A very thin white male who is dyspneic and having difficulty breathing at the moment.VITAL SIGNS: Afebrile. Heart rate in the 100s to 120s at times with atrial fibrillation. Respiratory rate is 17-20. Blood pressure 130s-150s/60s-70s.NECK: Soft and supple, full range of motion.HEART: Regular.ABDOMEN: Distended with tenderness mainly in the upper abdomen but very difficult to localize due to his difficulty providing information. He does appear to have tenderness but does not have rebound and does not have peritoneal signs.DIAGNOSTICS: A CT scan done on 11/02/07 shows pneumatosis in the cecum with an enlarged cecum filled with stool and air fluid levels with chronically dilated small bowel.ASSESSMENT: Possible ischemic cecum with possible metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis on atrial fibrillation, aspiration pneumonia, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, COPD, anemia with gastric ulcer.PLAN: The patient appears to have pneumatosis from a CT scan 2 days ago. Nothing was done about it at that time as the patient appeared to not be symptomatic, but he continues to have nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain, but the fact that pneumatosis was found 2 days ago and the patient has survived this long indicates this may be a benign process at the moment, and I would recommend getting a repeat CT scan to assess it further to see if there is worsening of pneumatosis versus resolution to further evaluate the liver lesions and make decisions regarding planning at that time. The patient has frequent desaturations secondary to his aspiration pneumonia, and any surgical procedure or any surgical intervention would certainly require intubation, which would then necessitate long-term ventilator care as he is not someone who would be able to come off of a ventilator very well in his current state. So we will look at the CT scan and make decisions based on the findings as far as that is concerned."

Osteomyelitis, paraplegia, and history of spina bifida.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Nonhealing decubitus ulcer, left ischial region? Osteomyelitis, paraplegia, and history of spina bifida.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Debridement left ischial ulcer.ANESTHESIA: Local MAC.INDICATIONS: This is a 27-year-old white male patient, with a history of spina bifida who underwent spinal surgery about two years ago and subsequently he has been paraplegic. The patient has a nonhealing decubitus ulcer in the left ischial region, which is quite deep. It appears to be right down to the bone. MRI shows findings suggestive of osteomyelitis. The patient is being brought to operating room for debridement of this ulcer. Procedure, indication, and risks were explained to the patient. Consent obtained.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was put in right lateral position and left buttock and ischial region was prepped and draped. Examination at this time showed fair amount of chronic granulation tissue and scarred tissue circumferentially as well as the base of this decubitus ulcer. This was sharply excised until bleeding and healthy tissue was obtained circumferentially as well as the base. The ulcer does not appear to be going into the bone itself as there was a covering on the bone, which appears to be quite healthy, normal and bone itself appeared solid.I did not rongeur the bone. The deeper portion of the excised tissue was also sent for tissue cultures. Hemostasis was achieved with cautery and the wound was irrigated with sterile saline solution and then packed with medicated Kerlix. Sterile dressing was applied. The patient transferred to recovery room in stable condition."
172,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Repair of juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with 14 mm Hemashield tube graft.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia.OPERATIVE TIME: Three hours.ANESTHESIA TIME: Four hours.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After thorough preoperative evaluation, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position and after placement of upper extremity IV access and radial A-line, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. A Foley catheter was placed and a right internal jugular central line was placed. The chest, abdomen, both groin, and perineum were prepped widely with Betadine and draped as a sterile field with an Ioban drape. A long midline incision from xiphoid to pubis was created with a scalpel and the abdomen was carefully entered. A sterile Omni-Tract was introduced into the field to retract the abdominal wall and gentle exploration of the abdomen was performed. With the exception of the vascular findings to be described, there were no apparent intra-abdominal abnormalities.The transverse colon retracted superiorly. The small bowel was wrapped in moist green towel and retracted in the right upper quadrant. The posterior peritoneum overlying the aneurysm was scribed mobilizing the ligament of Treitz thoroughly ligating and dividing the inferior mesenteric vein. Dissection continued superiorly to identify the left renal vein and the right and left inferior renal arteries. The mid left renal artery was likewise identified. The perirenal aorta was prepared for clamp superior to the inferior left renal artery. During this portion of the dissection, the patient was given multiple small doses of intravenous mannitol to establish an osmotic diuresis. The distal dissection was then completed exposing each common iliac artery. The arteries were suitable for control.The patient was then given 8000 units of intravenous sodium heparin and systemic anticoagulation verified by activated clotting time. The aneurysm was repaired.First, the common carotid arteries were controlled with atraumatic clamps. The inferior left renal artery was controlled with a microvascular clamp and a straight aortic clamp was used to control the aorta superior to this renal artery. The aneurysm was opened on the right anterior lateral aspect and an endarterectomy of the aneurysm sac was performed. There was a high-grade stenosis at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery and an eversion endarterectomy was performed at this site. The vessel was controlled with a microvascular clamp. Two pairs of lumbar arteries were oversewn with 2-0 silk. A 14 mm Hemashield tube graft was selected and sewn end-to-end fashion to the proximal aorta using a semi continuous 3-0 Prolene suture. At the completion of anastomosis three patch stitches of 3-0 Prolene were required for hemostasis. The graft was cut to appropriate length and sewn end-to-end at the iliac bifurcation using semi-continuous 3-0 Prolene suture. Prior to completion of this anastomosis, the graft was flushed of air and debris and blood flow was reestablished slowly to the distal native circulation first to the pelvis with external compression on the femoral vessels and finally to the distal native circulation. The distal anastomosis was competent without leak.The patient was then given 70 mg of intravenous protamine and final hemostasis obtained using electrocoagulation. The back bleeding from the inferior mesenteric artery was assessed and was pulsatile and vigorous. The colon was normal in appearance and this vessel was oversewn using 2-0 silk. The aneurysm sac was then closed about the grafts snuggly using 3-0 PDS in a vest-over-pants fashion. The posterior peritoneum was reapproximated using running 3-0 PDS. The entire large and small bowel were inspected and these structures were well perfused with a strong pulse within the SMA normal appearance of the entire viscera. The NG tube was positioned in the fundus of the stomach and the viscera returned to their anatomic location. The midline fascia was then reapproximated using running #1 PDS suture. The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with bacitracin and kanamycin solution. The skin edges coapted using surgical staples.At the conclusion of the case, sponge and needle counts were correct and a sterile occlusive compressive dressing was applied."

Hyperlipidemia.5. Hypertension.6. Congestive heart failure.7. Skin lymphoma 5 years ago.8. Hypothyroidism.HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 78-year-old female with past medical condition includes hypertension, end-stage renal disease, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and skin lymphoma who had a left AV fistula done about 3 days ago by Dr. X and the patient went later on home, but started having epigastric pain and right upper quadrant pain and mid abdominal pain, some nauseated feeling, and then she could not handle the pain, so came to the emergency room, brought by the family. The patient's initial assessment, the patient's vital signs were stable, showed temperature 97.9, pulse was 106, and blood pressure was 156/85. EKG was not available and ultrasound of the abdomen showed there is a renal cyst about 2 cm. There is sludge in the gallbladder wall versus a stone in the gallbladder wall. Thickening of the gallbladder wall with positive Murphy sign. She has a history of cholecystitis. Urine shows positive glucose, but negative for nitrite and creatinine was 7.1, sodium 131, potassium was 5.2, and lipase and amylase were normal. So, the patient admitted to the Med/Surg floor initially and the patient was started on IV fluid as well as low-dose IV antibiotic and 2-D echocardiogram and EKG also was ordered. The patient also had history of CHF in the past and recently had some workup done. The patient does not remember initially. Surgical consult also requested and blood culture and urine culture also ordered. The same day, the patient was seen by Dr. Y and the patient should need cholecystectomy, but the patient also needs dialysis and also needs to be cleared by the cardiologist, so the patient later on seen by Dr. Z and cleared the patient for the surgery with moderate risk and the patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patient also seen by nephrologist and underwent dialysis. The patient's white count went down 6.1, afebrile. On postop day #1, the patient started eating and also walking. The patient also had chronic bronchitis. The patient was later on feeling fine, discussed with surgery. The patient was then able to discharge to home and follow with the surgeon in about 3-5 days. Discharged home with Synthroid 0.5 mg 1 tablet p.o. daily, Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily, folic acid 1 mg p.o. daily, Diovan 80 mg p.o. daily, Renagel 2 tablets 800 mg p.o. twice a day, Lasix 40 mg p.o. 2 tablets twice a day, lovastatin 20 mg p.o. daily, Coreg 3.125 mg p.o. twice a day, nebulizer therapy every 3 hours as needed, also Phenergan 25 mg p.o. q.8 hours for nausea and vomiting, Pepcid 20 mg p.o. daily, Vicodin 1 tablet p.o. q.6 hours p.r.n. as needed, and Levaquin 250 mg p.o. every other day for the next 5 days. The patient also had Premarin that she was taking, advised to discontinue because of increased risk of heart disease and stroke explained to the patient. Discharged home."
174,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic appendectomy.INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: Include inflamed, non-perforated appendix.OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was seen by me in the preoperative holding area. The risks of the procedure were explained. She was taken to the operating room and given perioperative antibiotics prior to coming to the surgery. General anesthesia was carried out without difficulty and a Foley catheter was inserted. The left arm was tucked and the abdomen was prepped with Betadine and draped in sterile fashion. A 5-mm blunt port was inserted infra-umbilically at the level of the umbilicus under direct vision of a 5-mm 0-degree laparoscope. Once we were inside the abdominal cavity, CO2 was instilled to attain an adequate pneumoperitoneum. A left lower quadrant 5-mm port was placed under direct vision and a 12-mm port in the suprapubic region. The 5-mm scope was introduced at the umbilical port and the appendix was easily visualized. The base of the cecum was acutely inflamed but not perforated. I then was easily able to grasp the mesoappendix and create a window between the base of the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix. The window is big enough to get an Endo GIA blue cartridge through it and fired across the base of the mesoappendix without difficulty. I reloaded with a red vascular cartridge, came across the mesoappendix without difficulty. I then placed the appendix in an Endobag and brought out through the suprapubic port without difficulty. I reinserted the suprapubic port and irrigated out the right lower quadrant until dry. One final inspection revealed no bleeding from the staple line. We then removed all ports under direct vision, and there was no bleeding from the abdominal trocar sites. The pneumoperitoneum was then deflated and the suprapubic fascial defect was closed with 0-Vicryl suture. The skin incision was injected with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Monocryl suture. Steri-strips and sterile dressings were applied. No complications. Minimal blood loss. Specimen is the appendix. Brought to the recovery room in stable condition."
175,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ruptured appendicitis.PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic appendectomy.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This patient is a 4-year-old boy with less than 24-hour history of apparent right lower quadrant abdominal pain associated with vomiting and fevers. The patient has elevated white count on exam and CT scan consistent with acute appendicitis.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general endotracheal anesthesia. The patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A periumbilical incision was made. The fascia was incised. Peritoneal cavity entered bluntly. A 10-mm trocar and scope was passed. Peritoneal cavity was insufflated. Five-mm ports placed in left lower and hypogastric areas. On visualization of the right lower quadrant, appendix was visualized stuck against the right anterior abdominal wall, there is obvious site of perforation and leakage of content and pus. We proceeded to take the mesoappendix down to the base, and once the base was free, we placed GIA stapler across the base, fired the stapler, removed the appendix through the periumbilical port site. We irrigated and suctioned out the right lower and pelvic areas. We then removed the ports under direct visualization, closed the periumbilical port site fascia with 0 Vicryl, all skin incisions with 5-0 Monocryl, and dressed with Steri-Strips. The patient was extubated in the operating table and taken back to recovery room. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
176,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Appendicitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Appendicitis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic appendectomy.ANESTHESIA: General.COMPLICATIONS: None.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Infraumbilical incision was performed and taken down to the fascia. The fascia was incised. The peritoneal cavity was carefully entered. Two other ports were placed in the right and left lower quadrants. The appendix was readily identified, and the base of the appendix as well as the mesoappendix was divided with the Endo GIA stapler and brought out through the umbilical wound with the Endocatch bag.All hemostasis was further reconfirmed. No leakage of enteral contents was noted. All trocars were removed under direct visualization. The umbilical fascia was closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular stitch and dressed with Steri-Strips and 4 x 4's. The patient was extubated and taken to the recovery area in stable condition. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
177,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Appendicitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Appendicitis. PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic appendectomy. ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation. His abdomen was prepped and draped in a standard, sterile surgical fashion. A Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression. Marcaine was injected into his umbilicus. A small incision was made. A Veress needle was introduced in his abdomen. CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg and a 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through his umbilicus. A 5-mm port was then placed just to the right side of the umbilicus. Another 5-mm port was placed just suprapubic in the midline. Upon inspection of the cecum, I was able find an inflamed and indurated appendix. I was able to clear the mesentery at the base of the appendix between the appendix and the cecum. I fired a white load stapler across the appendix at its base and fired a grey load stapler across the mesentery, and thereby divided the mesentery and freed the appendix. I put the appendix in an Endocatch bag and removed it through the umbilicus. I irrigated out the abdomen. I then closed the fascia of the umbilicus with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason and closed the skin of all incisions with a running Monocryl. Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications."
178,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis with perforation.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis with perforation.ANESTHESIA: General.PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic appendectomy.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 4-year-old little boy, who has been sick for several days and was seen in our Emergency Department yesterday where a diagnosis of possible constipation was made, but he was sent home with a prescription for polyethylene glycol but became more acutely ill and returned today with tachycardia, high fever and signs of peritonitis. A CT scan of his abdomen showed evidence of appendicitis with perforation. He was evaluated in the Emergency Department and placed on the appendicitis critical pathway for this acute appendicitis process. He required several boluses of fluid for tachycardia and evidence of dehydration.I met with Carlos' parents and talked to them about the diagnosis of appendicis and surgical risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options. All their questions have been answered and they agree with the surgical plan.OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient had acute perforated appendicitis with diffuse suppurative peritonitis including multiple intraloop abscesses and purulent debris in all quadrants of the abdomen including the perihepatic and subphrenic recesses as well.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia. A Foley catheter was placed for decompression, and his abdomen was prepared and draped in a standard fashion. A 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated in the soft tissues around his umbilicus and in the suprapubic and left lower quadrant locations chosen for trocar insertion. We conducted our surgical timeout and reiterated all of Carlos' unique and important identifying information and confirmed the diagnosis of appendicitis and planned laparoscopic appendectomy as the procedure. A 1-cm vertical infraumbilical incision was made and an open technique was used to place a 12-mm Step trocar through the umbilical fascia. CO2 was insufflated to a pressure of 15 mmHg and then two additional 5-mm working ports were placed in areas that had been previously anesthetized.There was a lot of diffuse purulent debris and adhesions between the omentum and adjacent surfaces of the bowel and the parietal peritoneum. After these were gently separated, we began to identify the appendix. In the __________ due to the large amount of small bowel dilatation and distension, I used the hook cautery with the lowest intraperitoneal __________ profile to coagulate the mesoappendix. The base of the appendix was then ligated with 2-0 PDS Endoloops, and the appendix was amputated and withdrawn through the umbilical port. I spent the next 10 minutes irrigating purulent fluid and debris from the peritoneal cavity using 2 L of sterile crystalloid solution and a suction power irrigation system. When this was complete, the CO2 was released one final time and as much of the fluid was drained from the peritoneal cavity as possible. The umbilical fascia was closed with figure-of-eight suture of 0 Monocryl and the skin incisions were closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips. The patient tolerated the operation well. He was awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition. His blood loss was less than 10 mL, and he received only crystalloid fluid during the procedure."
179,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Appendicitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Appendicitis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic appendectomy.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.INDICATION FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 42-year-old female who presented with right lower quadrant pain. She was evaluated and found to have a CT evidence of appendicitis. She was subsequently consented for a laparoscopic appendectomy.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room, placed supine on the table. The abdomen was prepared and draped in usual sterile fashion. After the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, supraumbilical incision was made. A Veress needle was inserted. Abdomen was insufflated to 15 mmHg. A 5-mm port and camera placed. The abdomen was visually explored. There were no obvious abnormalities. A 15-mm port was placed in the suprapubic position in addition of 5 mm was placed in between the 1st two. Blunt dissection was used to isolate the appendix. Appendix was separated from surrounding structures. A window was created between the appendix and the mesoappendix. GIA stapler was tossed across it and fired. Mesoappendix was then taken with 2 fires of the vascular load on the GIA stapler. Appendix was placed in an Endobag and removed from the patient. Right lower quadrant was copiously irrigated. All irrigation fluids were removed. Hemostasis was verified. The 15-mm port was removed and the port site closed with 0-Vicryl in the Endoclose device. All other ports were irrigated, infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular sutures. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. Overall, the patient tolerated this well, was awakened and returned to recovery in good condition."
180,Gastroenterology,"The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on operating table in supine position. After adequate general endotracheal intubation, the patient underwent general anesthesia.The patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A subumbilical skin incision was made. The Veress needle was inserted, and the patient's abdominal cavity was insufflated with moderate pressure all times. A subumbilical trocar was inserted. The camera was inserted in the panoramic view. The abdomen demonstrated some inflammation around the gallbladder. A 10-mm midepigastric trocar was inserted. A. 2 mm and 5 mm trocars were inserted. The most lateral trocar grasping forceps was inserted and grasped the fundus of the gallbladder and placed in tension at liver edge.Using the dissector, the cystic duct was identified and double Hemoclips were invited well away from the cystic-common duct junction. The cystic artery was identified and double Hemoclips applied. The gallbladder was taken down from the liver bed using Endoshears and electrocautery. Hemostasis was obtained. The gallbladder was removed from the midepigastric trocar site without difficulty. The trocars were removed and the skin incisions were reapproximated using 4-0 Monocryl. Steri-Strips and sterile dressing were placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition."
181,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE:: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced. The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. An #11 blade scalpel was used to make a small infraumbilical skin incision in the midline. The fascia was elevated between two Ochsner clamps and then incised. A figure-of-eight stitch of 2-0 Vicryl was placed through the fascial edges. The 11-mm port without the trocar engaged was then placed into the abdomen. A pneumoperitoneum was established. After an adequate pneumoperitoneum had been established, the laparoscope was inserted. Three additional ports were placed all under direct vision. An 11-mm port was placed in the epigastric area. Two 5-mm ports were placed in the right upper quadrant. The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and slightly rotated to the left. The fundus of the gallbladder was retracted superiorly and laterally. The infundibulum was retracted inferiorly and laterally. Electrocautery was used to carefully begin dissection of the peritoneum down around the base of the gallbladder. The triangle of Calot was carefully opened up. The cystic duct was identified heading up into the base of the gallbladder. The cystic artery was also identified within the triangle of Calot. After the triangle of Calot had been carefully dissected, a clip was then placed high up on the cystic duct near its junction with the gallbladder. The cystic artery was clipped twice proximally and once distally. Scissors were then introduced and used to make a small ductotomy in the cystic duct, and the cystic artery was divided. An intraoperative cholangiogram was obtained. This revealed good flow through the cystic duct and into the common bile duct. There was good flow into the duodenum without any filling defects. The hepatic radicals were clearly visualized. The cholangiocatheter was removed, and two clips were then placed distal to the ductotomy on the cystic duct. The cystic duct was then divided using scissors. The gallbladder was then removed up away from the liver bed using electrocautery. The gallbladder was easily removed through the epigastric port site. The liver bed was then irrigated and suctioned. All dissection areas were inspected. They were hemostatic. There was not any bile leakage. All clips were in place. The right gutter up over the edge of the liver was likewise irrigated and suctioned until dry. All ports were then removed under direct vision. The abdominal cavity was allowed to deflate. The fascia at the epigastric port site was closed with a stitch of 2-0 Vicryl. The fascia at the umbilical port was closed by tying the previously placed stitch. All skin incisions were then closed with subcuticular sutures of 4-0 Monocryl and 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine was infiltrated into all port sites. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient is currently being aroused from general endotracheal anesthesia. I was present during the entire case."

The patient is also diabetic. The patient had a workup for her gallbladder, which showed evidence of biliary dyskinesia. The patient was then scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary colic and biliary dyskinesia.INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient's abdomen was explored. There was no evidence of any peritoneal studding or masses. The abdomen was otherwise within normal limits. The gallbladder was easily visualized. There was an intrahepatic gallbladder. There was no evidence of any inflammatory change.PROCEDURE: After informed written consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient. The patient was brought into the operating suite.After general endotracheal intubation, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion. Next, an infraumbilical incision was made with a #10 scalpel. The skin was elevated with towel clips and a Veress needle was inserted. The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg of pressure. The Veress needle was removed and a #10 blade trocar was inserted without difficulty. The laparoscope was then inserted through this #10 port and the abdomen was explored. There was no evidence of any peritoneal studding. The peritoneum was smooth. The gallbladder was intrahepatic somewhat. No evidence of any inflammatory change. There were no other abnormalities noted in the abdomen. Next, attention was made to placing the epigastric #10 port, which again was placed under direct visualization without difficulty. The two #5 ports were placed, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior axillary line again in similar fashion under direct visualization. The gallbladder was then grasped out at its fundus, elevated to patient's left shoulder. Using a curved dissector, the cystic duct was identified and freed up circumferentially. Next, an Endoclip was used to distal and proximal to the gallbladder, Endoshears were used in between to transect the cystic duct. The cystic artery was transected in similar fashion. Attention was next made in removing the gallbladder from the liver bed using electrobovie cautery and spatulated tip. It was done without difficulty. The gallbladder was then grasped via the epigastric port and removed without difficulty and sent to pathology. Hemostasis was maintained using electrobovie cautery. The liver bed was then copiously irrigated and aspirated. All the fluid and air was then aspirated and then all ports were removed under direct visualization. The two #10 ports were then closed in the fascia with #0 Vicryl and a UR6 needle. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl. 0.25% Marcaine was injected and Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Recovery in stable condition."

Chronic cholecystitis.NAME OF OPERATION: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.ANESTHESIA: General.FINDINGS: The gallbladder was thickened and showed evidence of chronic cholecystitis. There was a great deal of inflammatory reaction around the cystic duct. The cystic duct was slightly larger. There was a stone impacted in the cystic duct with the gallbladder. The gallbladder contained numerous stones which were small. With the stone impacted in the cystic duct, it was felt that probably none were within the common duct. Other than rather marked obesity, no other significant findings were noted on limited exploration of the abdomen.PROCEDURE: Under general anesthesia after routine prepping and draping, the abdomen was insufflated with the Veress needle, and the standard four trocars were inserted uneventfully. Inspection was made for any entry problems, and none were encountered.After limited exploration, the gallbladder was then retracted superiorly and laterally, and the cystic duct was dissected out. This was done with some difficulty due to the fibrosis around the cystic duct, but care was taken to avoid injury to the duct and to the common duct. In this manner, the cystic duct and cystic artery were dissected out. Care was taken to be sure that the duct that was identified went into the gallbladder and was the cystic duct. The cystic duct and cystic artery were then doubly clipped and divided, taking care to avoid injury to the common duct. The gallbladder was then dissected free from the gallbladder bed. Again, the gallbladder was somewhat adherent to the gallbladder bed due to previous inflammatory reaction. The gallbladder was dissected free from the gallbladder bed utilizing the endo shears and the cautery to control bleeding. The gallbladder was extracted through the operating trocar site, and the trocar was reinserted. Inspection was made of the gallbladder bed. One or two bleeding areas were fulgurated, and bleeding was well controlled."

The abdominal area was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A small skin incision was made below the umbilicus. It was carried down in the transverse direction on the side of her old incision. It was carried down to the fascia. An open pneumoperitoneum was created with Hasson technique. Three additional ports were placed in the usual fashion. The gallbladder was found to be acutely inflamed, distended, and with some necrotic areas. It was carefully retracted from the isthmus, and the cystic structure was then carefully identified, dissected, and divided between double clips. The gallbladder was then taken down from the gallbladder fossa with electrocautery. There was some bleeding from the gallbladder fossa that was meticulously controlled with a Bovie. The gallbladder was then finally removed via the umbilical port with some difficulty because of the size of the gallbladder and size of the stones. The fascia had to be opened. The gallbladder had to be opened, and the stones had to be extracted carefully. When it was completed, I went back to the abdomen and achieved complete hemostasis. The ports were then removed under direct vision with the scope. The fascia of the umbilical wound was closed with a figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl. All the incisions were injected with 0.25% Marcaine, closed with 4-0 Monocryl, Steri-Strips, and sterile dressing.The patient tolerated the procedure satisfactorily and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."

TITLE OF PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and intraoperative cholangiogram. ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine upon the operating room table. General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation. The abdomen was prepped and draped in standard sterile surgical fashion. Marcaine was injected through the umbilicus. A small incision was made in the umbilicus, and a Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen. CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg, and a 12-mm VersaStep port was placed into the umbilicus. I then placed a 5-mm port in the midline just subxiphoid, another 5-mm port in the midclavicular line just subcostal, and another 5-mm port in the mid-axillary line just subcostal. I grasped the fundus of the gallbladder and pulled it superiorly over the liver. The gallbladder was inflamed and did appear to have acute cholecystitis. There were some adhesions from the omentum, which were taken down. I grabbed the infundibulum of the gallbladder and pulled it inferolaterally, and thereby splayed out the cystic duct. The cystic duct was bluntly dissected. I put a clip distally against the gallbladder. I then cut a small hole in the cystic duct. I passed an Arrow catheter into the cystic duct and inflated the balloon. I injected dye under fluoroscopy, and I could feel the hepatic duct and the common bile duct. There were no stones in the common bile duct. The dye easily passed into the intestine. I then removed the Arrow catheter. I placed 2 clips proximally on the cystic duct, and I put an extra stitch through the duct at the very end with a Vicryl stitch to be sure that it was secured. I put 2 clips on the cystic artery, and 1 distally, and it was divided. I then took the gallbladder off the hepatic fossa using electrocautery. I placed it in an Endocatch bag and removed it through the umbilicus. I copiously irrigated out the abdomen. I then closed the fascia of the umbilicus with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture. I closed the skin of all incisions with running Monocryl. Sponge, instrument and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.

Intraoperative cholangiogram.ANESTHESIA: General.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general endotracheal anesthetic. The patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef intravenously piggyback. The abdomen was prepared and draped in routine sterile fashion.A 1-cm incision was made at the umbilicus and a Veress needle was inserted. Saline test was performed. Satisfactory pneumoperitoneum was achieved by insufflation of CO2 to a pressure of 14 mmHg. The Veress needle was removed. A 10- to 11-mm cannula was inserted. Inspection of the peritoneal cavity revealed a gallbladder that was soft and without adhesions to it. It was largely mobile. The liver had a normal appearance as did the peritoneal cavity. A 5-mm cannula was inserted in the right upper quadrant anterior axillary line. A second 5-mm cannula was inserted in the subcostal space. A 10- to 11-mm cannula was inserted into the upper midline.The gallbladder was reflected in a cephalad direction. The gallbladder was punctured with the aspirating needle, and under C-arm fluoroscopy was filled with contrast, filling the intra- and extrahepatic biliary trees, which appeared normal. Extra contrast was aspirated and the aspirating needle was removed. The ampulla was grasped with a second grasper, opening the triangle of Calot. The cystic duct was dissected and exposed at its junction with the ampulla, was controlled with a hemoclip, digitally controlled with two clips and divided. This was done while the common duct was in full visualization. The cystic artery was similarly controlled and divided. The gallbladder was dissected from its bed and separated from the liver, brought to the outside through the upper midline cannula and removed.The subhepatic and subphrenic spaces were irrigated thoroughly with saline solution. There was oozing and bleeding from the lateral 5-mm cannula site, but this stopped spontaneously with removal of the cannula. The subphrenic and subhepatic spaces were again irrigated thoroughly with saline until clear. Hemostasis was excellent. CO2 was evacuated and the camera removed. The umbilical fascia was closed with 2-0 Vicryl, the subcu with 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with 4-0 nylon. Sterile dressings were applied. Sponge and needle counts were correct."

Final pathology is pending.INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: Briefly, the patient is a 38-year-old male referred with increasingly severe more frequent right upper quadrant abdominal pain, more after meals, had a positive ultrasound for significant biliary sludge. He presented now after informed consent for the above procedure.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was identified in the preanesthesia area, then taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position on the operating table, and induced under general endotracheal anesthesia. The patient was correctly positioned, padded at all pressure points, had antiembolic TED hose and Flowtrons in the lower extremities. The anterior abdomen was then prepared and draped in a sterile fashion. Preemptive local anesthetic was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine and 0.5% ropivacaine. The initial incision was made sharply at the umbilicus with a #15-scalpel blade and carried down through deeper tissues with Bovie cautery, down to the midline fascia with a #15 scalpel blade. The blunt-tipped Hasson introducer cannula was placed into the abdominal cavity under direct vision where it was insufflated using carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg. The epigastric and right subcostal trocars were placed under direct vision. The right upper quadrant was well visualized. The gallbladder was noted to be significantly distended with surrounding dense adhesions. The fundus of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted anteriorly and superiorly, and the surrounding adhesions were then taken down off the gallbladder using a combination of the bullet-nose Bovie dissector and the blunt Kittner peanut dissector. Further dissection allowed identification of the infundibulum and cystic duct junction where the cystic duct was identified and dissected out further using a right-angle clamp. The cystic duct was clipped x3 and then divided. The cystic artery was dissected out in like fashion, clipped x3, and then divided. The gallbladder was then taken off the liver bed in a retrograde fashion using the hook-tip Bovie cautery with good hemostasis. Prior to removal of the gallbladder, all irrigation fluid was clear. No active bleeding or oozing was seen. All clips were noted to be secured and intact and in place. The gallbladder was placed in a specimen pouch after placing the camera in the epigastric port. The gallbladder was retrieved through the umbilical fascial defect and submitted to Pathology. The camera was placed back once again into the abdominal cavity through the umbilical port, and all areas remained clean and dry and the trocar was removed under direct visualization. The insufflation was allowed to escape. The umbilical fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl sutures. Finally, the skin was closed in a layered subcuticular fashion with interrupted 3-0 and 4-0 Monocryl. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
190,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.A 2 cm infraumbilical midline incision was made. The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp. A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia, gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident. Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adapter in order to occlude the fascial opening. Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady pressure of 16 mmHg.The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen under direct vision of the 30 degree laparoscope taking care to make the incisions along Langer's lines, spreading the subcutaneous tissues with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar. A total of 3 other trocars were placed. The first was a 10/11 mm trocar in the upper midline position. The second was a 5 mm trocar placed in the anterior iliac spine. The third was a 5 mm trocar placed to bisect the distance between the second and upper midline trocars. All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and was rotated slightly to the left. The gallbladder was then grasped through the second and third trocars and retracted cephalad toward the right shoulder. A laparoscopic dissector was then placed through the upper midline cannula, fitted with a reducer, and the structures within the triangle of Calot were meticulously dissected free.A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic duct proximally and distally. The duct was divided between the clips. The clips were carefully placed to avoid occluding the juncture with the common bile duct. The cystic artery was found medially and slightly posterior to the cystic duct. It was carefully dissected free from its surrounding tissues. A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic artery proximally and distally. The artery was divided between the clips. The 2 midline port sites were injected with 5% Marcaine.After the complete detachment of the gallbladder from the liver, the video laparoscope was removed and placed through the upper 10/11 mm cannula. The neck of the gallbladder was grasped with a large penetrating forceps placed through the umbilical 12 mm Hasson cannula. As the gallbladder was pulled through the umbilical fascial defect, the entire sheath and forceps were removed from the abdomen. The neck of the gallbladder was removed from the abdomen. Following gallbladder removal, the remaining carbon dioxide was expelled from the abdomen.Both midline fascial defects were then approximated using 0 Vicryl suture. All skin incisions were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. Dressings were applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct.Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
191,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Symptomatic cholelithiasis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Symptomatic cholelithiasis.PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appendectomy (CPT 47563, 44970).ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.INDICATIONS: This is an 18-year-old girl with sickle cell anemia who has had symptomatic cholelithiasis. She requested appendectomy because of the concern of future diagnostic dilemma with pain crisis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appendectomy were recommended to her. The procedure was explained in detail including the risks of bleeding, infection, biliary injury, retained common duct stones. After answering her questions, she wished to proceed and gave informed consent.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating table. She was positively identified and the correct surgical site and procedure reviewed. After successful administration of general endotracheal anesthesia, the skin of the abdomen was prepped with chlorhexidine solution and sterilely draped.The infraumbilical skin was infiltrated with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine and horizontal incision created. The linea alba was grasped with a hemostat and Veress needle was placed into the peritoneal cavity and used to insufflate carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg. A 12-mm expandable disposable trocar was placed and through this a 30 degree laparoscope was used to inspect the peritoneal cavity. Upper abdominal anatomy was normal. Pelvic laparoscopy revealed bilaterally closed internal inguinal rings. Additional trocars were placed under direct vision including a 5-mm reusable in the right lateral _____. There was a 12-mm expandable disposable in the right upper quadrant and a 5-mm reusable in the subxiphoid region. Using these, the gallbladder was grasped and retraced cephalad. Adhesions were taken down over the cystic duct and the duct was circumferentially dissected and clipped at the gallbladder cystic duct junction. A small ductotomy was created. Reddick cholangiogram catheter was then placed within the duct and the balloon inflated. Continuous fluoroscopy was used to instill contrast material. This showed normal common bile duct which entered the duodenum without obstruction. There was no evidence of common bile duct stones. The cholangiogram catheter was removed. The duct was doubly clipped and divided. The artery was divided and cauterized. The gallbladder was taken out of the gallbladder fossa. It was then placed in Endocatch bag and left in the abdomen. Attention was then paid to the appendix. The appendix was identified and window was made in the mesoappendix at the base. This was amputated with an Endo-GIA stapler. The mesoappendix was divided with an Endo-GIA vascular stapler. This was placed in another Endocatch bag. The abdomen was then irrigated. Hemostasis was satisfactory. Both the appendix and gallbladder were removed and sent for pathology. All trocars were removed. The 12-mm port sites were closed with 2-0 PDS figure-of-eight fascial sutures. The umbilical skin was reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl Rapide. The remaining skin incisions were closed with 5-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture. The skin was cleaned. Mastisol, Steri-Strips and band-aids were applied. The patient was awakened, extubated in the operating room, transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."
192,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute cholecystitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute gangrenous cholecystitis with cholelithiasis.OPERATION PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram.FINDINGS: The patient had essentially a dead gallbladder with stones and positive wide bile/pus coming from the gallbladder.COMPLICATIONS: None.EBL: Scant.SPECIMEN REMOVED: Gallbladder with stones.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion under general anesthesia. A curvilinear incision was made below the umbilicus. Through this incision, the camera port was able to be placed into the peritoneal cavity under direct visualization. Once this complete, insufflation was begun. Once insufflation was adequate, additional ports were placed in the epigastrium as well as right upper quadrant. Once all four ports were placed, the right upper quadrant was then explored. The patient had significant adhesions of omentum and colon to the liver, the gallbladder constituting definitely an acute cholecystitis. This was taken down using Bovie cautery to free up visualization of the gallbladder. The gallbladder was very thick and edematous and had frank necrosis of most of the anterior gallbladder wall. Adhesions were further taken down between the omentum, the colon, and the gallbladder slowly starting superiorly and working inferiorly towards the cystic duct area. Once the adhesions were fully removed, the cholangiogram was done which did not show any evidence of any common bile duct dilatation or obstruction. At this point, due to the patient's gallbladder being very necrotic, it was deemed that the patient should have a drain placed. The cystic duct and cystic artery were serially clipped and transected. The gallbladder was removed from the gallbladder fossa removing the entire gallbladder. Adequate hemostasis with Bovie cautery was achieved. The gallbladder was then placed into a bag and removed from the peritoneal cavity through the camera port. A JP drain was then run through the anterior port and out of one of the trochar sites and secured to the skin using 3-0 nylon suture. Next, the right upper quadrant was copiously irrigated out using the suction irrigator. Once this was complete, the additional ports were able to be removed. The fascial opening at the umbilicus was reinforced by closing it using a 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-8 fashion. All skin incisions were injected using Marcaine 1/4 percent plain. The skin was reapproximated further using 4-0 Monocryl sutures in a subcuticular technique. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was able to be transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."
193,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with attempted intraoperative cholangiogram.PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.A 2 cm infraumbilical midline incision was made. The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp. A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia, gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident. Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adapter in order to occlude the fascial opening. Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady pressure of 16 mmHg.The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen under direct vision of the 30 degree laparoscope taking care to make the incisions along Langer's lines, spreading the subcutaneous tissues with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar. A total of 3 other trocars were placed. The first was a 10/11 mm trocar in the upper midline position. The second was a 5 mm trocar placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 3 cm above the anterior superior iliac spine. The third was a 5 mm trocar placed to bisect the distance between the second and upper midline trocars. All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and was rotated slightly to the left. The gallbladder was then grasped through the second and third trocars and retracted cephalad toward the right shoulder. A laparoscopic dissector was then placed through the upper midline cannula, fitted with a reducer, and the structures within the triangle of Calot were meticulously dissected free.A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic duct close to the gallbladder. The gallbladder was then grasped through the upper midline cannula and a fine-tipped scissors introduced through the third cannula and used to make a small ductotomy in the cystic duct near the clips. Several attempts at passing the cholangiocatheter into the ductotomy were made. Despite numerous attempts at several angles, the cholangiocatheter could not be inserted into the cystic duct. After several such attempts, and due to the fact that the anatomy was clear, we aborted any further attempts at cholangiography. The distal cystic duct was doubly clipped. The duct was divided between the clips. The clips were carefully placed to avoid occluding the juncture with the common bile duct. The port sites were injected with 0.5% Marcaine.The cystic artery was found medially and slightly posteriorly to the cystic duct. It was carefully dissected free from its surrounding tissues. A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic artery proximally and distally. The artery was divided between the clips. The port sites were injected with 0.5% Marcaine.After the cystic duct and artery were transected, the gallbladder was dissected from the liver bed using Bovie electrocautery. Prior to complete dissection of the gallbladder from the liver, the peritoneal cavity was copiously irrigated with saline and the operative field was examined for persistent blood or bile leaks of which there were none.After the complete detachment of the gallbladder from the liver, the video laparoscope was removed and placed through the upper 10/11 mm cannula. The neck of the gallbladder was grasped with a large penetrating forceps placed through the umbilical 12 mm Hasson cannula. As the gallbladder was pulled through the umbilical fascial defect, the entire sheath and forceps were removed from the abdomen. The neck of the gallbladder was then secured with a Kocher clamp, and the gallbladder was removed from the abdomen.Following gallbladder removal, the remaining carbon dioxide was expelled from the abdomen.Both midline fascial defects were then approximated using 0 Vicryl suture. All skin incisions were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. Dressings were applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct.Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."

Liver cyst.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.COMPLICATIONS: None.OPERATIVE FINDINGS: Exploration of the abdomen revealed multiple adhesions of omentum overlying the posterior aspect of the gallbladder. Additionally, there was a notable liver cyst. The remainder of the abdomen remained free of any adhesions.BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 66-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital for an elective cholecystectomy. The patient complained of intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal bloating after eating fatty foods. She had had multiple attacks in the past of these complaints. She was discovered to have had right upper quadrant pain on examination. Additionally, she had an ultrasound performed on 08/04/2003, which revealed cholelithiasis. The patient was recommended to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for her recurrent symptoms. She was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and she gave informed consent to proceed.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position. The patient received preoperative antibiotics with Kefzol. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution. The patient did undergo general endotracheal anesthesia. Once the adequate sedation was achieved, a supraumbilical transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel. Utilizing a Veress needle, the Veress needle was inserted intra-abdominally and was hooked to the CO2 insufflation. The abdomen was insufflated to 15 mmHg. After adequate insufflation was achieved, the laparoscopic camera was inserted into the abdomen and to visualize a distended gallbladder as well as omental adhesion adjacent to the gallbladder. Decision to proceed with laparoscopic cystectomy was decided. A subxiphoid transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel and utilizing a bladed 12 mm trocar, the trocar was inserted under direct visualization into the abdomen. Two 5 mm ports were placed, one at the midclavicular line 2 cm below the costal margin and a second at the axillary line, one hand length approximately below the costal margin. All ports were inserted with bladed 5 mm trocar then under direct visualization. After all trocars were inserted, the gallbladder was grasped at the fundus and retracted superiorly and towards the left shoulder. Adhesions adjacent were taken down with a Maryland dissector. Once this was performed, the infundibulum of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted laterally and anteriorly. This helped to better delineate the cystic duct as well as the cystic artery. Utilizing Maryland dissector, careful dissection of the cystic duct and cystic artery were created posteriorly behind each one. Utilizing Endoclips, clips were placed on the cystic duct and cystic artery, one proximal to the gallbladder and two distally. Utilizing endoscissors, the cystic duct and cystic artery were ligated. Next, utilizing electrocautery, the gallbladder was carefully dissected off the liver bed. Electrocautery was used to stop any bleeding encountered along the way. The gallbladder was punctured during dissection and cleared, biliary contents did drained into the abdomen. No evidence of stones were visualized. Once the gallbladder was completely excised from the liver bed, an EndoCatch was placed and the gallbladder was inserted into EndoCatch and removed from the subxiphoid port. This was sent off as an specimen, a gallstone was identified within the gallbladder. Next, utilizing copious amounts of irrigation, the abdomen was irrigated. A small liver cyst that have been identified upon initial aspiration was grasped with a grasper and utilizing electrocautery was completely excised off the left lobe of the liver. This was also taken and sent off as specimen. The abdomen was then copiously irrigated until clear irrigation was identified. All laparoscopic ports were removed under direct visualization. The abdomen was de-insufflated. Utilizing #0 Vicryl suture, the abdominal fascia was approximated with a figure-of-eight suture in the supraumbilical and subxiphoid region. All incisions were then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl. Two midline incisions were closed with a running subcuticular stitch and the lateral ports were closed with interrupted sutures. The areas were cleaned and dried. Steri-Strips were placed. On the incisions, sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. She was extubated following procedure. She is seen to tolerate the procedure well and she will follow up with Dr. X within one week for a follow-up evaluation."
195,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Morbid obesity.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Morbid obesity.PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic antecolic antegastric Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with EEA anastomosis.ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation.INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 30-year-old female, who has been overweight for many years. She has tried many different diets, but is unsuccessful. She has been to our Bariatric Surgery Seminar, received some handouts, and signed the consent. The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. All pressure points were carefully padded. She was given general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. SCD stockings were placed on both legs. Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression. The abdomen was then prepped and draped in standard sterile surgical fashion. Marcaine was then injected through umbilicus. A small incision was made. A Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen. CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg. A 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through the umbilicus. I then placed a 5-mm port just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal on the right side. I placed another 5-mm port in the midclavicular line just subcostal on the right side, a few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 12-mm VersaStep port. On the left side, just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal, I placed a 5-mm port. A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port. I began by lifting up the omentum and identifying the transverse colon and lifting that up and thereby identifying my ligament of Treitz. I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm and divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler. I then divided the mesentery all the way down to the base of the mesentery with a LigaSure device. I then ran the distal bowel down, approximately 100 cm, and at 100 cm, I made a hole at the antimesenteric portion of the Roux limb and a hole in the antimesenteric portion of the duodenogastric limb, and I passed a 45 white load stapler and fired a stapler creating a side-to-side anastomosis. I reapproximated the edges of the defect. I lifted it up and stapled across it with another white load stapler. I then closed the mesenteric defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures. I divided the omentum all the way down to the colon in order to create a passageway for my small bowel to go antecolic. I then put the patient in reverse Trendelenburg. I placed a liver retractor, identified, and dissected the angle of His. I then dissected on the lesser curve, approximately 2.5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction, and got into a lesser space. I fired transversely across the stomach with a 45 blue load stapler. I then used two fires of the 60 blue load with SeamGuard to go up into my angle of His, thereby creating my gastric pouch. I then made a hole at the base of the gastric pouch and had Anesthesia remove the bougie and place the OG tube connected to the anvil. I pulled the anvil into place, and I then opened up my 15-mm port site and passed my EEA stapler. I passed that in the end of my Roux limb and had the spike come out antimesenteric. I joined the spike with the anvil and fired a stapler creating an end-to-side anastomosis, then divided across the redundant portion of my Roux limb with a white load GI stapler, and removed it with an Endocatch bag. I put some additional 2-0 Vicryl sutures in the anastomosis for further security. I then placed a bowel clamp across the bowel. I went above and passed an EGD scope into the mouth down to the esophagus and into the gastric pouch. I distended gastric pouch with air. There was no air leak seen. I could pass the scope easily through the anastomosis. There was no bleeding seen through the scope. We closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason. I copiously irrigated out that incision with about 2 L of saline. I then closed the skin of all incisions with running Monocryl. Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications."
196,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Morbid obesity. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Morbid obesity. PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, antecolic, antegastric with 25-mm EEA anastamosis, esophagogastroduodenoscopy. ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 50-year-old male who has been overweight for many years and has tried multiple different weight loss diets and programs. The patient has now begun to have comorbidities related to the obesity. The patient has attended our bariatric seminar and met with our dietician and psychologist. The patient has read through our comprehensive handout and understands the risks and benefits of bypass surgery as evidenced by the signing of our consent form.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The risks and benefits were explained to the patient. Consent was obtained. The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation. A Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression. All pressure points were carefully padded, and sequential compression devices were placed on the legs. The abdomen was prepped and draped in standard, sterile, surgical fashion. Marcaine was injected into the umbilicus. A small incision was made, and a Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen. CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg. Then a 12-mm VersaStep port was placed in the umbilicus. Laparoscopic examination showed no injuries from entry. I then placed a 5-mm port in the left side just subcostal and just anterior to the mid-axillary line. A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port. On the right side just subcostal and anterior to the mid-axillary line, I placed another 5-mm port. Another 5-mm port was placed just to the right of the midline and just subxiphoid, and a few centimeters below that, a 12-mm VersaStep port was placed. We began by identifying the colon and lifting the transverse colon up and thereby identifying the ligament of Treitz. I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm. I divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler. I then divided across the mesentery utilizing a LigaSure device all the way down to its base. I then ran the distal bowel down 100 cm, and at 100 cm I made a hole in the Roux limb and a hole in the duodenogastric limb. I placed a 45 white load stapler into the abdomen and put 1 side of the white load stapler in the duodenogastric limb and 1 side in the Roux limb. I fired the stapler, thereby creating a side-to-side anastomosis. I reapproximated the defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures and then stapled across it with a white load GIA stapler. I then did a Brolin anti-obstruction stitch with an interrupted Surgidac suture. I then closed the mesenteric defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures. I then divided the omentum all the way down to the transverse colon in order to create a pathway to place the Roux limb antecolic, antegastric. I then placed the patient in reverse Trendelenburg position and placed a liver retractor. I first identified the angle of His and made sure that it was clearly visible. I then had Anesthesia drop a balloon into the stomach and blow it up to 30 cc. Below that, I then cleared the mesentery at the lesser curve and got behind the stomach into the lesser space. I then fired a blue load stapler transversely across the stomach, after checking with Anesthesia that everything had been removed from the stomach. I then made a hole into the stomach at the mid portion of the superior staple line. I then made an incision on the greater curve and made a gastrotomy. I then brought a 25 EEA anvil with a stitch attached to it into the abdominal cavity. I placed an angulating grasper into the gastrotomy above my staple line and had it come out through the gastrotomy at the greater curve. I grabbed the anvil and pulled it through the greater curve gastrotomy and had the stem come out through the superior staple line so that the stem was now coming out through the base of my soon-to-be gastric pouch.I then completed my pouch by firing 60 blue loads with SeamGuard cephalad up and through the angle of His. After creating the pouch, I then closed the gastrotomy on the greater curve by firing across it with blue load stapler. Once this had been done, I brought up the Roux limb. I cut a hole in the antimesenteric portion of the Roux limb and passed a 25 EEA stapler into the abdomen through the 15-mm port site and had it go in through the enterotomy. I had a spike come out on the antimesenteric portion of the small bowel. I removed the spike and joined the stapler with the anvil and fired the stapler, thereby creating the anastomosis, and then removed the EEA stapler. I divided the end of the redundant portion of the Roux limb that had the enterotomy utilizing a white load stapler and removed that through the 15-mm port site. I then had a pretty straight shot from the pouch into the small bowel. I put additional 3-0 Vicryl sutures in the corners in order to take off any tension and further secure the wound. I then put a bowel clamp on the bowel. I went above and performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy. I placed a scope into the mouth and down through the esophagus with ease. I passed it into the stomach pouch. I distended up the pouch with air. There was no air leak seen laparoscopically. I was able to pass the scope easily across the anastomosis. No bleeding was seen. I then withdrew the scope and scrubbed back into the case. I closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason. I then put a 10-flat Jackson-Pratt through the left upper quadrant incision and sutured that in place using nylon. I then closed the skin of all incisions with a running Monocryl. Prior to closing, I irrigated the 15-mm port site with dilute Betadine. Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications."
197,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right lower quadrant abdominal pain, rule out acute appendicitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute suppurative appendicitis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:1. Diagnostic laparoscopy.2. Laparoscopic appendectomy.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal and injectable 1% lidocaine and 0.25% Marcaine.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.SPECIMEN: Appendix.COMPLICATIONS: None.BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 37-year-old Caucasian female presented to ABCD General Hospital with progressively worsening suprapubic and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which progressed throughout its course starting approximately 12 hours prior to presentation. She admits to some nausea associated with it. There have been no fevers, chills, and/or genitourinary symptoms. The patient had right lower quadrant tenderness with rebound and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant. She had a leukocytosis of 12.8. She did undergo a CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which was non diagnostic for an acute appendicitis. Given the severity of her abdominal examination and her persistence of her symptoms, we recommend the patient undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with probable need for laparoscopic appendectomy and possible open appendectomy. The risks, benefits, complications of the procedure, she gave us informed consent to proceed.OPERATIVE FINDINGS: Exploration of the abdomen via laparoscopy revealed an appendix with suppurative fluid surrounding it, it was slightly enlarged. The left ovary revealed some follicular cysts. There was no evidence of adnexal masses and/or torsion of the fallopian tubes. The uterus revealed no evidence of mass and/or fibroid tumors. The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operative suite, placed in the supine position. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution. The patient underwent general endotracheal anesthesia. The patient also received a preoperative dose of Ancef 1 gram IV. After adequate sedation was achieved, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make an infraumbilical transverse incision utilizing a Veress needle. Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen and the abdomen was insufflated approximately 15 mmHg. Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a 10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty. A video laparoscope was inserted into the infraumbilical trocar site and the abdomen was explored. Next, a 5 mm port was inserted in the midclavicular line of the right upper quadrant region. This was inserted under direct visualization. Finally, a suprapubic 12 mm portal was created. This was performed with #10 blade scalpel to create a transverse incision. A bladed trocar was inserted into the suprapubic region. This was done again under direct visualization. Maryland dissector was inserted into the suprapubic region and a window was created between the appendix and mesoappendix at the base of the cecum. This was done while the 5 mm trocar was used to grasp the middle portion of the appendix and retracted anteriorly. Utilizing a endovascular stapling device, the appendix was transected and doubly stapled with this device. Next, the mesoappendix was doubly stapled and transected with the endovascular stapling device. The staple line was visualized and there was no evidence of bleeding. The abdomen was fully irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline. The abdomen was then aspirated. There was no evidence of bleeding. All ports were removed under direct visualization. No evidence of bleeding from the port sites. The infraumbilical and suprapubic ports were then closed. The fascias were then closed with #0-Vicryl suture on a UR6 needle. Once the fascias were closed, all incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl. The areas were cleaned, Steri-Strips were placed across the wound. Sterile dressing was applied.The patient tolerated the procedure well. She was extubated following the procedure, returned to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition. She will be admitted to General Medical Floor and she will be followed closely in the early postoperative course."
198,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Acute pain.2. Fever postoperatively.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:1. Acute pain.2. Fever postoperatively.3. Hemostatic uterine perforation.4. No bowel or vascular trauma.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:1. Diagnostic laparoscopy.2. Rigid sigmoidoscopy by Dr. X.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.COMPLICATIONS: None.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Scant.SPECIMEN: None.INDICATIONS: This is a 17-year-old African-American female, gravida-1, para-1, and had a hysteroscopy and dilation curettage on 09/05/03. The patient presented later that evening after having increasing abdominal pain, fever and chills at home with a temperature up to 101.2. The patient denied any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. She does complain of some frequent urination. Her vaginal bleeding is minimal.FINDINGS: On bimanual exam, the uterus is approximately 6-week size, anteverted, and freely mobile with no adnexal masses appreciated. On laparoscopic exam, there is a small hemostatic perforation noted on the left posterior aspect of the uterus. There is approximately 40 cc of serosanguineous fluid in the posterior cul-de-sac. The bilateral tubes and ovaries appeared normal. There is no evidence of endometriosis in the posterior cul-de-sac or along the bladder flap. There is no evidence of injury to the bowel or pelvic sidewall. The liver margin, gallbladder and remainder of the bowel including the appendix appeared normal.PROCEDURE: After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the Operating Room where general anesthetic was administered. The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion. A sterile speculum was placed in the patient's vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum. The uterine manipulator was then placed into the patient's cervix and the vulsellum tenaculum and sterile speculum were removed. Gloves were changed and attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made. Veress needle was placed through this incision and the gas turned on. When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate. A 11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision. The camera was placed with the above findings noted. A 5 mm step trocar was placed 2 cm superior to the pubic bone and along the midline. A blunt probe was placed through this trocar to help for visualization of the pelvic and abdominal organs. The serosanguineous fluid of the cul-de-sac was aspirated and the pelvis was copiously irrigated with sterile saline. At this point, Dr. X was consulted. He performed a rigid sigmoidoscopy, please see his dictation for further details. There does not appear to be any evidence of colonic injury. The saline in the pelvis was then suctioned out using Nezhat-Dorsey. All instruments were removed. The 5 mm trocar was removed under direct visualization with excellent hemostasis noted. The camera was removed and the abdomen was allowed to desufflate. The 11 mm trocar introducer was replaced and the trocar removed. The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion. Approximately 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was injected into the incision sites for postoperative pain relief. Steri-Strips were then placed across the incision. The uterine manipulator was then removed from the patient's cervix with excellent hemostasis noted. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure. The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.She will be followed immediately postoperatively within the hospital and started on IV antibiotics."
199,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and recurrent biliary colic.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Severe cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, and morbid obesity.PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Laparoscopy, laparotomy, cholecystectomy with operative cholangiogram, choledocholithotomy with operative choledochoscopy and T-tube drainage of the common bile duct.ANESTHESIA: General.INDICATIONS: This is a 63-year-old white male patient with multiple medical problems including hypertension, diabetes, end-stage renal disease, coronary artery disease, and the patient is on hemodialysis, who has had recurrent episodes of epigastric right upper quadrant pain. The patient was found to have cholelithiasis on last admission. He was being worked up for this including cardiac clearance. However, in the interim, he returned again with another episode of same pain. The patient had a HIDA scan done yesterday, which shows nonvisualization of the gallbladder consistent with cystic duct obstruction. Because of these, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was advised with cholangiogram. Possibility of open laparotomy and open procedure was also explained to the patient. The procedure, indications, risks, and alternatives were discussed with the patient in detail and informed consent was obtained.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia. The entire abdomen was prepped and draped. A small transverse incision was made about 2-1/2 inches above the umbilicus in the midline under local anesthesia. The patient has a rather long torso. Fascia was opened vertically and stay sutures were placed in the fascia. Peritoneal cavity was carefully entered. Hasson cannula was inserted into the peritoneal cavity and it was insufflated with CO2. Laparoscopic camera was inserted and examination at this time showed difficult visualization with a part of omentum and hepatic flexure of the colon stuck in the subhepatic area. The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg and rotated to the left. An 11-mm trocar was placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5-mm in the right subcostal region. Slowly, the dissection was carried out in the right subhepatic area. Initially, I was able to dissect some of the omentum and hepatic flexure off the undersurface of the liver. Then, some inflammatory changes were noted with some fatty necrosis type of changes and it was not quite clear whether this was part of the gallbladder or it was just pericholecystic infection/inflammation. The visualization was extremely difficult because of the patient's obesity and a lot of fat intra-abdominally, although his abdominal wall is not that thick. After evaluating this for a little while, we decided that there was no way that this could be done laparoscopically and proceeded with formal laparotomy. The trocars were removed.A right subcostal incision was made and peritoneal cavity was entered. A Bookwalter retractor was put in place. The dissection was then carried out on the undersurface of the liver. Eventually, the gallbladder was identified, which was markedly scarred down and shrunk and appeared to have palpable stone in it. Dissection was further carried down to what was felt to be the common bile duct, which appeared to be somewhat larger than normal about a centimeter in size. The duodenum was kocherized. The gallbladder was partly intrahepatic. Because of this, I decided not to dig it out of the liver bed causing further bleeding and problem. The inferior wall of the gallbladder was opened and two large stones, one was about 3 cm long and another one about 1.5 x 2 cm long, were taken out of the gallbladder.It was difficult to tell where the cystic duct was. Eventually after probing near the neck of the gallbladder, I did find the cystic duct, which was relatively very short. Intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram was done using C-arm fluoroscopy. This showed a rounded density at the lower end of the bile duct consistent with the stone. At this time, a decision was made to proceed with common duct exploration. The common duct was opened between stay sutures of 4-0 Vicryl and immediately essentially clear bile came out. After some pressing over the head of the pancreas through a kocherized maneuver, the stone did fall into the opening in the common bile duct. So, it was about a 1-cm size stone, which was removed. Following this, a 10-French red rubber catheter was passed into the common bile duct both proximally and distally and irrigated generously. No further stones were obtained. The catheter went easily into the duodenum through the ampulla of Vater. At this point, a choledochoscope was inserted and proximally, I did not see any evidence of any common duct stones or proximally into the biliary tree. However, a stone was found distally still floating around. This was removed with stone forceps. The bile ducts were irrigated again. No further stones were removed. A 16-French T-tube was then placed into the bile duct and the bile duct was repaired around the T-tube using 4-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures obtaining watertight closure. A completion T-tube cholangiogram was done at this time, which showed slight narrowing and possibly a filling defect proximally below the confluence of the right and left hepatic duct, although externally, I was unable to see anything or palpate anything in this area. Because of this, the T-tube was removed, and I passed the choledochoscope proximally again, and I was unable to see any evidence of any lesion or any stone in this area. I felt at this time this was most likely an impression from the outside, which was still left over a gallbladder where the stone was stuck and it was impressing on the bile duct. The bile duct lumen was widely open. T-tube was again replaced into the bile duct and closed again and a completion T-tube cholangiogram appeared to be more satisfactory at this time. The cystic duct opening through which I had done earlier a cystic duct cholangiogram, this was closed with a figure-of-eight suture of 2-0 Vicryl, and this was actually done earlier and completion cholangiogram did not show any leak from this area.The remaining gallbladder bed, which was left in situ, was cauterized both for hemostasis and to burn off the mucosal lining. Subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic spaces were irrigated with sterile saline solution. Hemostasis was good. A 10-mm Jackson-Pratt drain was left in the foramen of Winslow and brought out through the lateral 5-mm port site. The T-tube was brought out through the middle 5-mm port site, which was just above the incision. Abdominal incision was then closed in layers using 0 Vicryl running suture for the peritoneal layer and #1 Novafil running suture for the fascia. Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 3-0 Vicryl running sutures in two layers. Subfascial and subcutaneous tissues were injected with a total of 20 mL of 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine for postoperative pain control. The umbilical incision was closed with 0 Vicryl figure-of-eight sutures for the fascia, 2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissues, and staples for the skin. Sterile dressing was applied, and the patient transferred to recovery room in stable condition."
200,Gastroenterology,"TITLE OF PROCEDURE: Percutaneous liver biopsy.ANALGESIA: 2% Lidocaine.ALLERGIES: The patient denied any allergy to iodine, lidocaine or codeine.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The procedure was described in detail to the patient at a previous clinic visit and by the medical staff today. The patient was told of complications which might occur consisting of bleeding, bile peritonitis, bowel perforation, pneumothorax, or death. The risks and benefits of the procedure were understood, and the patient signed the consent form freely.With the patient lying in the supine position and the right hand underneath the head, an area of maximal dullness was identified in the mid-axillary location by percussion. The area was prepped and cleaned with povidone iodine following which the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and serosal surfaces were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine down to the capsule of the liver. Next, a small incision was made with a Bard-Parker #11 scalpel. A 16-gauge modified Klatskin needle was inserted through the incision and into the liver on one occasion with the patient in deep expiration. Liver cores measuring *** cm were obtained and will be sent to Pathology for routine histologic study.POST-PROCEDURE COURSE AND DISPOSITION: The patient will remain under close observation in the medical treatment room for four to six hours and then be discharged home without medication. Normal activities can be resumed tomorrow. The patient is to contact me if severe abdominal or chest pain, fever, melena, light-headedness or any unusual symptoms develop. An appointment will be made for the patient to see me in the clinic in the next few weeks to discuss the results of the liver biopsy so that management decisions can be made.COMPLICATIONS: None.RECOMMENDATIONS: Prior to discharge, hepatitis A and B vaccines will be recommended. Risks and benefits for vaccination have been addressed and the patient will consider this option."

202,Gastroenterology,"HISTORY: Reason for ICU followup today is acute anemia secondary to upper GI bleeding with melena with dropping hemoglobin from 11 to 8, status post transfusion of 2 units PRBCs with EGD performed earlier today by Dr. X of Gastroenterology confirming diagnosis of ulcerative esophagitis, also for continuing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with productive cough, infection and shortness of breath. Please see dictated ICU transfer note yesterday detailing the need for emergent transfer transfusion and EGD in this patient. Over the last 24 hours, the patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit and hemoglobin have returned to their baseline of approximately 11 appropriate for hemoglobin value. He also underwent EGD earlier today with Dr. X. I have discussed the case with him at length earlier this afternoon and the patient had symptoms of ulcerative esophagitis with no active bleeding. Dr. X recommended to increase the doses of his proton pump inhibitor and to avoid NSAIDs in the future. The patient today complains that he is still having issues with shortness of breath and wheezing and productive cough, now producing yellow-brown sputum with increasing frequency, but he has had no further episodes of melena since transfer to the ICU. He is also complaining of some laryngitis and some pharyngitis, but is denying any abdominal complaints, nausea, or diarrhea.PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONVITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure is 100/54, heart rate 80 and temperature 98.8. Is and Os negative fluid balance of 1.4 liters in the last 24 hours.GENERAL: This is a somnolent 68-year-old male, who arouses to voice, wakes up, seems to have good appetite, has continuing cough. Pallor is improved.EYES: Conjunctivae are now pink.ENT: Oropharynx is clear.CARDIOVASCULAR: Reveals distant heart tones with regular rate and rhythm.LUNGS: Have coarse breath sounds with wheezes, rhonchi, and soft crackles in the bases.ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender with no organomegaly appreciated.EXTREMITIES: Showed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema. Capillary refill time is now normal in the fingertips.NEUROLOGICAL: Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact with no focal neurological deficits.LABORATORY DATA: Laboratories drawn at 1449 today, WBC 10, hemoglobin and hematocrit 11.5 and 33.1, and platelets 288,000. This is up from 8.6 and 24.7. Platelets are stable. Sodium is 134, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, bicarb 26, BUN 19, creatinine 1.0, glucose 73, calcium 8.4, INR 0.96, iron 13%, saturations 4%, TIBC 312, TSH 0.74, CEA elevated at 8.6, ferritin 27.5 and occult blood positive. EGD, final results pending per Dr. X's note and conversation with me earlier, ulcerative esophagitis without signs of active bleeding at this time.IMPRESSION/PLAN1. Melena secondary to ulcerative esophagitis. We will continue to monitor the patient overnight to ensure there is no further bleeding. If there are no further episodes of melena and hemoglobin is stable or unchanged in the morning, the patient will be transferred back to medical floor for continuing treatment of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. The patient is doing well, taking PO. We will continue him on his oral Omnicef and azithromycin and continuing breathing treatments. We will add guaifenesin and N-acetyl-cysteine in a hope to mobilize some of his secretions. This does appear to be improving. His white count is normalized and I am hopeful we can discharge him on oral antibiotics within the next 24 to 48 hours if there are no further complications.3. Elevated CEA. The patient will need colonoscopy on an outpatient basis. He has refused this today. We would like to encourage him to do so. Of note, the patient when he came in was on bloodless protocol, but with urging did accept the transfusion. Similarly, I am hoping that with proper counseling, the patient will consent to further examination with colonoscopy given his guaiac-positive status, elevated CEA and risk factors.4. Anemia, normochromic normocytic with low total iron binding capacity. This appears to be anemia of chronic disease. However, this is likely some iron deficiency superimposed on top of this given his recent bleeding, with consider iron, vitamin C, folate and B12 supplementation and discharge given his history of alcoholic malnutrition and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. Total critical care time spent today discussing the case with Dr. X, examining the patient, reviewing laboratory trends, adjusting medications and counseling the patient in excess is 35 minutes."

204,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Nissen fundoplication.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained detailing the risks of infection, bleeding, esophageal perforation and death, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was then placed in a modified lithotomy position taking great care to pad all extremities. TEDs and Venodynes were placed as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis. Antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection.A 52-French bougie was placed in the proximal esophagus by Anesthesia, above the cardioesophageal junction. A 2 cm midline incision was made at the junction of the upper two-thirds and lower one-third between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process. The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp. A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident. Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adaptor in order to occlude the fascial opening. Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady state of pressure of 16 mmHg. A 30-degree laparoscope was inserted through this port and used to guide the remaining trocars.The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen taking care to make the incisions along Langer's line, spreading the subcutaneous tissue with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar. A total of 4 other 10/11 mm trocars were placed. Under direct vision 1 was inserted in the right upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a right supraumbilical position; another at the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a left supraumbilical position; 1 under the right costal margin in the anterior axillary line; and another laterally under the left costal margin on the anterior axillary line. All of the trocars were placed without difficulty. The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position.The triangular ligament was taken down sharply, and the left lobe of the liver was retracted superolaterally using a fan retractor placed through the right lateral cannula. The gastrohepatic ligament was then identified and incised in an avascular plane. The dissection was carried anteromedially onto the phrenoesophageal membrane. The phrenoesophageal membrane was divided on the anterior aspect of the hiatal orifice. This incision was extended to the right to allow identification of the right crus. Then along the inner side of the crus, the right esophageal wall was freed by dissecting the cleavage plane.The liberation of the posterior aspect of the esophagus was started by extending the dissection the length of the right diaphragmatic crus. The pars flaccida of the lesser omentum was opened, preserving the hepatic branches of the vagus nerve. This allowed free access to the crura, left and right, and the right posterior aspect of the esophagus, and the posterior vagus nerve.Attention was next turned to the left anterolateral aspect of the esophagus. At its left border, the left crus was identified. The dissection plane between it and the left aspect of the esophagus was freed. The gastrophrenic ligament was incised, beginning the mobilization of the gastric pouch. By dissecting the intramediastinal portion of the esophagus, we elongated the intra-abdominal segment of the esophagus and reduced the hiatal hernia.The next step consisted of mobilization of the gastric pouch. This required ligation and division of the gastrosplenic ligament and several short gastric vessels using the harmonic scalpel. This dissection started on the stomach at the point where the vessels of the greater curvature turned towards the spleen, away from the gastroepiploic arcade. The esophagus was lifted by a Babcock inserted through the left upper quadrant port. Careful dissection of the mesoesophagus and the left crus revealed a cleavage plane between the crus and the posterior gastric wall. Confirmation of having opened the correct plane was obtained by visualizing the spleen behind the esophagus. A one-half inch Penrose drain was inserted around the esophagus and sewn to itself in order to facilitate retraction of the distal esophagus. The retroesophageal channel was enlarged to allow easy passage of the antireflux valve.The 52-French bougie was then carefully lowered into the proximal stomach, and the hiatal orifice was repaired. Two interrupted 0 silk sutures were placed in the diaphragmatic crura to close the orifice.The last part of the operation consisted of the passage and fixation of the antireflux valve. With anterior retraction on the esophagus using the Penrose drain, a Babcock was passed behind the esophagus, from right to left. It was used to grab the gastric pouch to the left of the esophagus and to pull it behind, forming the wrap. The52-French bougie was used to calibrate the external ring. Marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control. The skin incision was approximated with skin staples. A dressing was then applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct.Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
205,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute acalculous cholecystitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute hemorrhagic cholecystitis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Open cholecystectomy.ANESTHESIA: Epidural with local.COMPLICATIONS: None.DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition.SPECIMEN: Gallbladder.BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 73-year-old female who presented to ABCD General Hospital on 07/23/2003 secondary to a fall at home from which the patient suffered a right shoulder as well as hip fracture. The patient subsequently went to the operating room on 07/25/2003 for a right hip hemiarthroplasty per the Orthopedics Department. Subsequently, the patient was doing well postoperatively, however, the patient does have severe O2 and steroid-dependent COPD and at an extreme risk for any procedure. The patient began developing abdominal pain over the course of the next several days and a consultation was requested on 08/07/2003 for surgical evaluation for upper abdominal pain. During the evaluation, the patient was found to have an acute acalculous cholecystitis in which nonoperative management was opted for and on 08/08/03, the patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement to drain the gallbladder. The patient did well postdrainage. The patient's laboratory values and biliary values returned to normal and the patient was planned for a removal of the tube with 48 hours of the tubing clamp. However, once the tube was removed, the patient re-obstructed with recurrent symptoms and a second tube was needed to be placed; this was done on 08/16/2003. A HIDA scan had been performed, which showed no cystic duct obstruction. A tube cholecystogram was performed, which showed no cystic or common duct obstruction. There was abnormal appearance of the gallbladder, however, the pathway was patent. Thus after failure of two nonoperative management therapies, extensive discussions were made with the family and the patient's only option was to undergo a cholecystectomy. Initial thoughts were to do a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, however, with the patient's severe COPD and risk for ventilator management, the options were an epidural and an open cholecystectomy under local was made and to be performed.INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient's gallbladder had some patchy and necrosis areas. There were particular changes on the serosal surface as well as on the mucosal surface with multiple clots within the gallbladder. The patient also had no plane between the gallbladder and the liver bed.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and discussed with the patient's family. The patient was brought to the operating room after an epidural was performed per anesthesia. Local anesthesia was given with 1% lidocaine. A paramedian incision was made approximately 5 cm in length with a #15 blade scalpel. Next, hemostasis was obtained using electro Bovie cautery. Dissection was carried down transrectus in the midline to the posterior rectus fascia, which was grasped with hemostats and entered with a #10 blade scalpel. Next, Metzenbaum scissors were used to extend the incision and the abdomen was entered . The gallbladder was immediately visualized and brought up into view, grasped with two ring clamps elevating the biliary tree into view. Dissection with a ______ was made to identify the cystic artery and cystic duct, which were both easily identified. The cystic artery was clipped, two distal and one proximal to the gallbladder cutting between with Metzenbaum scissors. The cystic duct was identified. A silk tie #3-0 silk was placed one distal and one proximal with #3-0 silk and then cutting in between with a Metzenbaum scissors. The gallbladder was then removed from the liver bed using electro Bovie cautery. A plane was created. The hemostasis was obtained using the electro Bovie cautery as well as some Surgicel. The gallbladder was then removed as specimen, sent to pathology for frozen sections for diagnosis, of which the hemorrhagic cholecystitis was diagnosed on frozen sections. Permanent sections are still pending. The remainder of the fossa was hemostatic with the Surgicel and attention was next made to closing the abdomen. The peritoneum as well as posterior rectus fascia was approximated with a running #0 Vicryl suture and then the anterior rectus fascia was closed in interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl sutures. Skin staples were used on the skin and sterile dressings were applied and the patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition."
206,Gastroenterology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 48-year-old man who has had abdominal pain since October of last year associated with a 30-pound weight loss and then developed jaundice. He had epigastric pain and was admitted to the hospital. A thin-slice CT scan was performed, which revealed a 4 x 3 x 2 cm pancreatic mass with involved lymph nodes and ring enhancing lesions consistent with liver metastases. The patient, additionally, had a questionable pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas. The patient underwent ERCP on 04/04/2007 with placement of a stent. This revealed a strictured pancreatic duct, as well as strictured bile duct. A 10-french x 9 cm stent was placed with good drainage. The next morning, the patient felt quite a bit more comfortable. He additionally had a modest drop in his bilirubin and other liver tests. Of note, the patient has been having quite a bit of nausea during his admission. This responded to Zofran. It did not, initially, respond well to Phenergan, though after stent placement, he was significantly more comfortable and had less nausea, and in fact, had better response to the Phenergan itself. At the time of discharge, the patient's white count was 9.4, hemoglobin 10.8, hematocrit 32 with a MCV of 79, platelet count of 585,000. His sodium was 132, potassium 4.1, chloride 95, CO2 27, BUN of 8 with a creatinine of 0.3. His bilirubin was 17.1, alk phos 273, AST 104, ALT 136, total protein 7.8 and albumin of 3.8. He was tolerating a regular diet. The patient had been on oral hypoglycemics as an outpatient, but in hospital, he was simply managed with an insulin sliding scale. The patient will be transferred back to Pelican Bay, under the care of Dr. X at the infirmary. He will be further managed for his diabetes there. The patient will additionally undergo potential end of life meetings. I discussed the potentials of chemotherapy with patient. Certainly, there are modest benefits, which can be obtained with chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer, though at some cost with morbidity. The patient will consider this and will discuss this further with Dr. X. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Phenergan 25 mg q.6. p.r.n.2. Duragesic patch 100 mcg q.3.d.3. Benadryl 25-50 mg p.o. q.i.d. for pruritus.4. Sliding scale will be discontinued at the time of discharge and will be reinstituted on arrival at Pelican Bay Infirmary.5. The patient had initially been on enalapril here. His hypertension will be managed by Dr. X as well. PLAN: The patient should return for repeat ERCP if there are signs of stent occlusion such as fever, increased bilirubin, worsening pain. In the meantime, he will be kept on a regular diet and activity per Dr. X."
207,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal mass.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal mass.PROCEDURE: Paracentesis.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: This 64-year-old female has stage II endometrial carcinoma, which had been resected before and treated with chemotherapy and radiation. At the present time, the patient is under radiation treatment. Two weeks ago or so, she developed a large abdominal mass, which was cystic in nature and the radiologist inserted a pigtail catheter in the emergency room. We proceeded to admit the patient and drained a significant amount of clear fluid in the subsequent days. The cytology of the fluid was negative and the culture was also negative. Eventually, the patient was sent home with the pigtail shut off and the patient a week later underwent a repeat CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.The CAT scan showed accumulation of the fluid and the mass almost achieving 80% of the previous size. Therefore, I called the patient home and she came to the emergency department where the service was provided. At that time, I proceeded to work on the pigtail catheter after obtaining an informed consent and preparing and draping the area in the usual fashion. Unfortunately, the catheter was open. I did not have a drainage system at that time. So, I withdrew directly with a syringe 700 mL of clear fluid. The system was connected to the draining bag, and the patient was instructed to keep a log and how to use equipment. She was given an appointment to see me in the office next Monday, which is three days from now."
208,Gastroenterology,"EXAM: Ultrasound-guided paracentesisHISTORY: Ascites.TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent was obtained from the patient after the risks and benefits of the procedure were thoroughly explained. Ultrasound demonstrates free fluid in the abdomen. The area of interest was localized with ultrasonography. The region was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner. Local anesthetic was administered. A 5-French Yueh catheter needle combination was taken. Upon crossing into the peritoneal space and aspiration of fluid, the catheter was advanced out over the needle. A total of approximately 5500 mL of serous fluid was obtained. The catheter was then removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate postprocedure complications.IMPRESSION: Ultrasound-guided paracentesis as above."
209,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Protein-calorie malnutrition.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Protein-calorie malnutrition.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.ANESTHESIA: Conscious sedation per Anesthesia.SPECIMEN: None.COMPLICATIONS: None.HISTORY: The patient is a 73-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with some mentation changes. He was unable to sustain enough caloric intake and had markedly decreased albumin stores. After discussion with the patient and the son, they agreed to place a PEG tube for nutritional supplementation.PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite. He was placed in the supine position and was given IV sedation by the Anesthesia Department. An EGD was performed from above by Dr. X. The stomach was transilluminated and an optimal position for the PEG tube was identified using the single poke method. The skin was infiltrated with local and the needle and sheath were inserted through the abdomen into the stomach under direct visualization. The needle was removed and a guidewire was inserted through the sheath. The guidewire was grasped from above with a snare by the endoscopist. It was removed completely and the Ponsky PEG tube was secured to the guidewire.The guidewire and PEG tube were then pulled through the mouth and esophagus and snug to the abdominal wall. There was no evidence of bleeding. Photos were taken. The Bolster was placed on the PEG site. A complete dictation for the EGD will be done separately by Dr. X. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition. He will be started on tube feedings in 6 hours with aspiration precautions and dietary to determine his nutritional goal."
210,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bleeding after transanal excision five days ago.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bleeding after transanal excision five days ago.PROCEDURE: Exam under anesthesia with control of bleeding via cautery.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.INDICATION: The patient is a 42-year-old gentleman who is five days out from transanal excision of a benign anterior base lesion. He presents today with diarrhea and bleeding. Digital exam reveals bright red blood on the finger. He is for exam under anesthesia and control of hemorrhage at this time.FINDINGS: There was an ulcer where most of the polypoid lesion had been excised before. In a near total fashion the wound had opened and again there was a raw ulcer surface in between the edges of the mucosa. There were a few discrete sites of mild oozing, which were treated with cautery and #1 suture. No other obvious bleeding was seen.TECHNIQUE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operative table in supine position. After adequate general anesthesia was induced, the patient was then placed in modified prone position. His buttocks were taped, prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The anterior rectal wall was exposed using a Parks anal retractor. The entire wound was visualized with a few rotations of the retractor and a few sites along the edges were seen to be oozing and were touched up with cautery. There was one spot in the corner that was oozing and this may have been from simply opening the retractor enough to see well. This was controlled with a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight suture. At the completion, there was no bleeding, no oozing, it was completely dry, and we removed our retractor, and the patient was then turned and extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition."
211,Gastroenterology,"PRESENTATION: A 16-year-old male presents to the emergency department (ED) with rectal bleeding and pain on defecation.HISTORY: A 16-year-old African American male presents to the ED with a chief complaint of rectal bleeding and pain on defecation. The patient states that he was well until about three days prior to presentation when he first started to experience some pain when defecating. The following day he noted increasing pain and first noted blood on the surface of his stool. The pain worsened on the subsequent day with increasing bleeding as well as some mucopurulent anal discharge. The patient denies any previous history of rectal bleeding or pain. He also denies any previous sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and states that he was screened for HIV infection eight months ago and was negative. The patient does state that he has not felt well for the past week. He states that he had felt ""feverish"" on several occasions but has not taken his temperature. He has also complained of some abdominal discomfort with nausea and diarrhea as well as generalized myalgias and fatigue. He thinks he has lost a few pounds but has not been weighing himself to determine the exact amount of weight loss.The patient states that he has been sexually active since age 13. He admits to eight previous partners and states that he ""usually"" uses a condom. On further questioning, the patient states that of his eight partners, three were female and five were male. His most recent sexual partner was a 38-year-old man whom he has been with for the past six months. He states that he has been tested for STDs in the past but states that he only gave urine and blood for the testing. He is unaware of the HIV status of his partner but assumes that the partner is uninfected because he looks healthy. The patient also admits to one episode of sexual abuse at the age of 8 by a friend of the family. As the man was a member of the family's church, the patient never felt comfortable disclosing this to any of the adults in his life. He is very concerned about disclosure of his sexual behavior to his family, as they have expressed very negative comments concerning men who have sex with men. He is accessing care in the ED unaccompanied by an adult.PHYSICAL EXAM: Thin but non-toxic young man with clear discomfort.Pulse = 105RR = 23BP = 120/62HEENT: Several areas of white plaque-like material on the buccal mucosa.Neck: Multiple anterior/posterior cervical nodes in both anterior and posterior chains- 1-2 cm in diameter.Lungs: Clear to auscultation.Cardiac: Quiet precordium.Nl S1/S2 with a II/VI systolic murmur. Abdomen: Soft without hepatosplenomegaly.GU: Tanner V male with no external penile lesions.Lymph: 2-3 cm axillary nodes bilaterally.1-2 cm epitrochlear nodes.Multiple 1-2 cm inguinal nodes.Rectal: Extremely painful digital exam.+ gross blood and mucous.LABORATORY EVALUATION:Hbg = 12. 5 gm/dLHct = 32%WBC = 3.9 thou/µLPlatelets = 120,000 thou/µL76% neutrophils19% lymphocytes1% eosinophils4% monocytesALT = 82 U/LAST= 90 U/LErythrocyte sedimentation rate = 90Electrolytes = normalGram stain of anal swab: numerous WBCsDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: This patient is presenting with acute rectal pain with bleeding and anal discharge. The patient also presents with some constitutional symptoms including fever, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and adenopathy on physical examination. The following are in the differential diagnosis: Acute Proctitis and Proctocolitis.ACUTE HIV SEROCONVERSION: This subject is sexually active and reports inconsistent condom use. Gastrointestinal symptoms have recently been reported commonly in patients with a history of HIV seroconversion. The rectal symptoms of bleeding and pain are not common with HIV, and an alternative diagnosis would be required.PERIRECTAL ABSCESS: A patient with a history of receptive anal intercourse is at risk for developing a perirectal abscess either from trauma or a concurrent STD. The patient could experience more systemic symptoms with fever and malaise, as found with this patient. However, the physical examination did not reveal the typical localized area of pain and edema.DIAGNOSIS: The subject had rectal cultures obtained, which were positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. An HIV ELISA was positive, as was the RNA PCR.DISCUSSION: This patient demonstrates a number of key issues to consider when caring for an adolescent or young adult. First, the patient utilized the emergency department for care as opposed to identifying a primary care provider. Although not ideal in many circumstances, testing for HIV infection is crucial when there is suspicion, since many newly diagnosed patients identify earlier contacts with health care providers when HIV counseling and testing were not performed. Second, this young man has had both male and female sexual partners. As young people explore their sexuality, asking about partners in an open, nonjudgmental manner without applying labels is integral to helping the young person discuss their sexual behaviors. Assuming heterosexuality is a major barrier to disclosure for many young people who have same-sex attractions. Third, screening for STDs must take into account sexual behaviors. Although urine-based screening has expanded testing of young people, it misses anal and pharyngeal infections. If a young person is only having receptive oral or anal intercourse, urine screening is insufficient to rule out STDs. Fourth, this young man had both localized and systemic symptoms. As his anal symptoms were most suggestive of a current STD, performing an HIV test should be part of the standard evaluation. In addition, as acute infection is on the differential diagnosis, PCR testing should also be considered. The care provided to this young man included the following. He was treated presumptively for proctitis with both IM ceftriaxone as well as oral doxycycline to treat N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis. Ceftriaxone was chosen due to the recent reports of resistant N gonorrhoeae. At the time of the diagnosis, the young man was given the opportunity to meet with the case manager from the adolescent-specific HIV program. The case manager linked this young man directly to care after providing brief counseling and support. The case manager maintained contact with the young man until his first clinical visit four days later. Over the subsequent three months, the young man had two sets of laboratory testing to stage his HIV infection.Set #1 CD4 T-lymphocyte count = 225 cells/mm3, 15% Quantitative RNA PCR = 75,000 copies/mLSet #2 CD4 T-lymphocyte count = 385 cells/mm3, 21%Quantitative RNA PCR = 12,000 copies/mLThe risks and benefits of ART were discussed over three clinical visits. This patient agreed with not starting ART and following his CD4 and viral loads every three months."
212,Gastroenterology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic male who was seen initially in the office February 15, 2006, with epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, and bloating. The patient at that time stated that he had established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. Since the last visit the patient was asked to sign a lease of information form and we sent request for information from the doctor the patient saw before, Dr. X in Las Cruces and his primary care physician in Silver City, and unfortunately we did not get any information from anybody. Also the patient had admission in Gila Medical Center with epigastric pain, diarrhea, and confusion. He spent 3 days in the hospital. He was followed by Dr. X and unfortunately we also do not have the information of what was wrong with the patient. From the patient's report he was diagnosed with some kind of viral infection. At the time of admission he had a lot of epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills.PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONVITAL SIGNS: Weight 107, height 6 feet 1 inch, blood pressure 128/67, heart rate 74, saturation 98%; pain is 3/10 with localization of the pain in the epigastric area.HEENT: PERRLA. EOM intact. Oropharynx is clear of lesions.NECK: Supple. No lymphadenopathy. No thyromegaly.LUNGS: Clear to auscultation and percussion bilateral.CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.ABDOMEN: Not tender, not distended. Splenomegaly about 4 cm under the costal margin. No hepatomegaly. Bowel sounds present.MUSCULOSKELETAL: No cyanosis, no clubbing, no pitting edema.NEUROLOGIC: Nonfocal. No asterixis. No costovertebral tenderness.PSYCHE: The patient is oriented x4, alert and cooperative.LABORATORY DATA: We were able to collect lab results from Medical Center; we got only CMP from the hospital which showed glucose level 79, BUN 9, creatinine 0.6, sodium 136, potassium 3.5, chloride 104, CO2 23.7, calcium 7.3, total protein 5.9, albumin 2.5, total bilirubin 5.63. His AST 56, ALT 37, alkaline phosphatase 165, and his ammonia level was 53. We do not have any other results back. No hepatitis panels. No alpha-fetoprotein level. The patient told me today that he also got an ultrasound of the abdomen and the result was not impressive, but we do not have this result despite calling medical records in the hospital to release this information.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is a 55-year-old with established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, unknown cause.1. Epigastric pain. The patient had chronic pain syndrome, he had multiple back surgeries, and he has taken opiate for a prolonged period of time. In the office twice the patient did not have any abdominal pain on physical exam. His pain does not sound like obstruction of common bile duct and he had these episodes of abdominal pain almost continuously. He probably requires increased level of pain control with increased dose of opiates, which should be addressed with his primary care physician.2. End-stage liver disease. Of course, we need to find out the cause of the liver cirrhosis. We do not have hepatitis panel yet and we do not have information about the liver biopsy which was performed before. We do not have any information of any type of investigation in the past. Again, patient was seen by gastroenterologist already in Las Cruces, Dr. X. The patient was advised to contact Dr. X by himself to convince him to send available information because we already send release information form signed by the patient without any result. It will be not reasonable to repeat unnecessary tests in that point in time.We are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alpha-fetoprotein level. We will also need to get information about ultrasound which was done in Gila Medical Center, but obviously no tumor was found on this exam of the liver. We have to figure out hepatitis status for another reason if he needs vaccination against hepatitis A and B. Until now we do not know exactly what the cause of the patient's end-stage liver disease is and my differential diagnosis probably is hepatitis C. The patient denied any excessive alcohol intake, but I could not preclude alcohol-related liver cirrhosis also. We will need to look for nuclear antibody if it is not done before. PSC is extremely unlikely but possible. Wilson disease also possible diagnosis but again, we first have to figure out if these tests were done for the patient or not. Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency will be extremely unlikely because the patient has no lung problem. On his end-stage liver disease we already know that he had low platelet count splenomegaly. We know that his bilirubin is elevated and albumin is very low. I suspect that at the time of admission to the hospital the patient presented with encephalopathy. We do not know if INR was checked to look for coagulopathy. The patient had an EGD in 2005 as well as colonoscopy in Silver City. We have to have this result to evaluate if the patient had any varices and if he needs any intervention for that.At this point in time, I recommended the patient to continue to take lactulose 50 mL 3 times daily. The patient tolerated it well; no diarrhea at this point in time. I also recommended for him to contact his primary care physician for increased dose of opiates for him. As a primary prophylaxis of GI bleeding in patient with end-stage liver disease we will try to use Inderal. The patient got a prescription for 10 mg pills. He will take 10 mg twice daily and we will gradually increase his dose until his heart rate will drop to 25% from 75% to probably 60-58. The patient was educated how to use Inderal and he was explained why we decided to use this medication. The patient will hold this medication if he is orthostatic or bradycardic.Again, the patient and his wife were advised to contact all offices they have seen before to get information about what tests were already done and if on the next visit in 2 weeks we still do not have any information we will need to repeat all these tests I mentioned above.We also discussed nutrition issues. The patient was provided information that his protein intake is supposed to be about 25 g per day. He was advised not to over-eat protein and advised not to starve. He also was advised to stay away from alcohol. His next visit is in 2 weeks with all results available."

The differential diagnosis includes paralytic ileus and mechanical obstruction. Paralytic ileus, which is characterized by absence of bowel sounds, gas scattered in the GI tract, dilation of the entire bowel, and a recent abdominal surgery, is unlikely in this case. AF is more likely suffering from a bowel obstruction: he has multiple risk factors (past abdominal surgery, multiple episodes of obstruction from adhesions) and symptoms and signs (bowel sounds, vomiting) consistent with obstruction.Mechanical bowel obstruction can be caused by:1. Adhesions (most cases): typically from prior surgeries.2. Hernias (second most common cause).3. Tumors (15% of cases): rare in small intestine; most common cause of large intestine obstruction.4. Intussusception (especially in kids).5. Volvulus (especially in elderly).6. Obturation: fecal impactions, gallstone ileus, parasitic infections.7. Inflammatory lesions: TB, regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, amebiasis.8. Vascular obstruction: embolism, increased venous pressure, hypercoagulability, vascular disease; especially in elderly.Given the patient's history of multiple abdominal surgeries and adhesions causing small bowel obstruction, AF's obstruction is most likely caused by adhesions.One question to answer in any patient presenting with bowel obstruction is whether the obstruction is in the small or large intestine. In small bowel obstruction, the pain is sharp and frequent, with early vomiting and electrolyte imbalance. In contrast, large bowel obstruction may present in elderly patients without vomiting, and typically without hernias or a history of abdominal surgery. Radiographic studies can definitively locate the site of the obstruction. In this patient, though the radiographic evidence was equivocal, the presence of vomiting and the quality and frequency of his pain suggested small bowel obstruction.PLAN: There has been a great deal of debate about the best way to treat patients with mechanical obstruction. I will focus on the question of whether a patient should be managed conservatively or with an operation. This question is vital because mechanical obstruction may lead to strangulation and perforation, life-threatening consequences. There is no reliable way to determine whether the patient is already suffering from strangulated bowel, and next to impossible to predict which patients will suffer from strangulation.Patients that have hernias are sent immediately to the operating room for a repair; the surgeon will resect any nonviable bowel. For patients suffering from an obstruction due to adhesions, the decision becomes difficult. Fifteen percent of these patients may have strangulating obstruction. Simple (nonstrangulating) bowel obstruction typically presents with intermittent, colicky pain. Strangulating obstruction, in contrast, usually presents with steady unrelenting pain. Other signs include a palpable mass, increased temperature and heart rate, and lab studies indicating acute inflammation.Several studies have examined the ability of these signs to predict when strangulation is present. After a study of 238 patients with small bowel obstruction, Stewardson et al. (1978) suggest that physicians, instead of considering individual signs, look at a combination of ""classic findings"" including leukocytosis, fever, tachycardia, and localized tenderness. They recommend conservative treatment only for patients with none or only one of these signs. Ninety percent of patients with strangulated bowel had two or more signs. Bizer et al. (1981), on the other hand, found no correlation between these signs and the presence of strangulation. They did find a correlation with age, feculent vomiting, peristaltitic sounds, and a white cell count above 18,000.It is clear that there are no absolute guidelines determining whether a patient can be treated conservatively or must get an operation. Improvements in imaging techniques in the recent past have aided in these critical decisions. Computed tomography can frequently be used to diagnose strangulation, however in the majority of cases misses the diagnosis. Apparently, the decision to operate ultimately falls on the judgment of the surgeon who must take into account all of the findings in combination.The operative treatment of mechanical obstruction is removing the obstruction resecting nonviable bowel, and creating a bypass if necessary. Conservative treatment primarily includes decompression, rehydration, and frequent monitoring. The physician must also decide on what type of tube should be used to decompress, and how long the nonoperative treatment will be attempted before resorting to surgery. The question of the tube has been a controversy for years, some advocating the nasogastric tube for all patients, others advocating a nasointestinal tube for distal obstructions. Maglinte et al. (2001) explain that nasointestinal tubes are more effective at decompressing distal obstructions, and suggest that physicians use a multipurpose tube that can be used as a nasogatric tube, a nasointestinal tube, and a diagnostic tool (can provide route for enteroclysis). Nasogastric tubes are especially unable to decompress distal distention in patients with a competent pyloric sphincter.Finally, the length of the trial period of nonoperative management is also debatable. Seror et al. (1993) suggest a 5-day trial to allow time for spontaneous resolution, and report a 73% success rate in a study of patients with a history of bowel surgery. In contrast, Deutsch et al. (1989) suggest only a 24 hour trial of conservative therapy, and only for patients with partial obstruction. Again, it appears as though this decision presently is at the discretion of the surgeon caring for the patient.In the case of patient AF, his findings made the decision to operate particularly difficult. He was clearly tachycardic; his WBC was elevated, but not above 18,000. His abdominal pain was steady and unrelenting, and could be localized to the LLQ, but he was afebrile. His abdominal CT was consistent with small bowel obstruction, but not definitive. In the end, based on the team's desire to avoid another abdominal surgery that could lead to more adhesions and another obstruction, we chose conservative management, with nasogastric tube decompression, rehydration, and close observation."

Closure of incidental colotomy.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia.IV FLUIDS: Crystalloid 1400 ml.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Thirty ml.DRAINS: Gastrostomy tube was placed to Foley.SPECIMENS: None.FINDINGS: Stomach located high in the peritoneal cavity. Multiple adhesions around the stomach to the diaphragm and liver.HISTORY: The patient is a 59-year-old black male who is indigent, an ethanol and tobacco abuse. He presented initially to the emergency room with throat and bleeding. Following evaluation by ENT and biopsy, it was determined to be squamous cell carcinoma of the right tonsil and soft palate, The patient is to undergo radiation therapy and possibly chemotherapy and will need prolonged enteral feeding with a bypass route from the mouth. The malignancy was not obstructing. Following obtaining informed consent for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube with possible conversion to open procedure, we elected to proceed following diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and election for radiation therapy.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was placed in the supine position and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. Preoperatively, 1 gram of Ancef was given. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. After anesthesia was achieved, an endoscope was placed down into the stomach, and no abnormalities were noted. The stomach was insufflated with air and the endoscope was positioned in the midportion and directed towards the anterior abdominal wall. With the room darkened and intensity turned up on the endoscope, a light reflex was noted on the skin of the abdominal wall in the left upper quadrant at approximately 2 fingerbreadths inferior from the most inferior rib. Finger pressure was applied to the light reflex with adequate indentation on the stomach wall on endoscopy. A 21-gauge 1-1/2 inch needle was initially placed at the margin of the light reflex, and this was done twice. Both times it was not visualized on the endoscopy. At this point, repositioning was made and, again, what was felt to be adequate light reflex was obtained, and the 14-gauge angio catheter was placed. Again, after two attempts, we were unable to visualize the needle in the stomach endoscopically. At this point, decision was made to convert the procedure to an open Stamm gastrostomy.OPEN STAMM GASTROSTOMY: A short upper midline incision was made and deepened through the subcutaneous tissues. Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery. The linea alba was identified and incised, and the peritoneal cavity was entered. The abdomen was explored. Adhesions were lysed with electrocautery under direct vision. The stomach was identified, and a location on the anterior wall near the greater curvature was selected. After lysis of adhesions was confirmed, we sufficiently moved the original chosen site without tension. A pursestring suture of #3-0 silk was placed on the interior surface of the stomach, and a second #3-0 pursestring silk stitch was placed exterior to that pursestring suture. An incision was then made at the location of the anterior wall which was near the greater curvature and was dissected down to the anterior abdominal wall. A Vanderbilt was used to pass through the abdominal wall in through the skin and then returned to the level of the skin and pulled the Bard feeding tube through the anterior wall into the field. An incision in the center of the pursestring suture on the anterior surface of the stomach was then made with electrocautery. The interior pursestring suture was sutured into place in such a manner as to inkwell the stomach around the catheter. The second outer concentric pursestring suture was then secured as well and tied to further inkwell the stomach. The stomach was then tacked to the anterior abdominal wall at the catheter entrance site with four #2-0 silk sutures in such a manner as to prevent leakage or torsion. The catheter was then secured to the skin with two #2-0 silk sutures. Hemostasis was checked and the peritoneal cavity was washed out and brought to the surgical field. Prior to the initiation of the gastrotomy, the bowel was run and at that time there was noted to be one incidental colotomy. This was oversewn with three #4-0 silk Lembert sutures. At the completion of the operation, the fascia was closed with #1 interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with staples. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition."

220,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gastrostomy (gastrocutaneous fistula).POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gastrostomy (gastrocutaneous fistula).OPERATION PERFORMED: Surgical closure of gastrostomy.ANESTHESIA: General.INDICATIONS: This 1-year-old child had a gastrostomy placed due to feeding difficulties. Since then, he has reached a point where he is now eating completely by mouth and no longer needed the gastrostomy. The tube was, therefore, removed, but the tract has not shown signs of spontaneous closure. He, therefore, comes to the operating room today for surgical closure of his gastrostomy.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: After the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual manner. An elliptical incision was made around the gastrostomy site and carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection. The tract and the stomach were freed. Stay sutures were then placed on either side of the tract. The tract was amputated. The intervening stomach was then closed with interrupted #4-0 Lembert, Nurolon sutures. The fascia was then closed over the stomach using #3-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with #5-0 subcuticular Monocryl. A dressing was applied, and the child was awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."
221,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal rupture.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal rupture.OPERATION PERFORMED1. Left thoracotomy with drainage of pleural fluid collection.2. Esophageal exploration and repair of esophageal perforation.3. Diagnostic laparoscopy and gastrostomy.4. Radiographic gastrostomy tube study with gastric contrast, interpretation.ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia.INDICATIONS OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of chronic esophageal stricture who is admitted with food sticking and retching. He has esophageal rupture on CT scan and comes now for a thoracotomy and gastrostomy.DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: After an extensive informed consent discussion process, the patient was brought to the operating room. He was placed in a supine position on the operating table. After induction of general anesthesia and placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube, he was turned and placed in a right lateral decubitus position on a beanbag with appropriate padding and axillary roll. Left chest was prepped and draped in a usual sterile fashion. After administration of intravenous antibiotics, a left thoracotomy incision was made, dissection was carried down to the subcutaneous tissues, muscle layers down to the fifth interspace. The left lung was deflated and the pleural cavity entered. The Finochietto retractor was used to help provide exposure. The sixth rib was shingled in the posterior position and a careful expiration of the left pleural cavity was performed.Immediately encountered was left pleural fluid including some purulent fluid. Cultures of this were sampled and sent for microbiology analysis. The left pleural space was then copiously irrigated. A careful expiration demonstrated that the rupture appeared to be sealed. There was crepitus within the mediastinal cavity. The mediastinum was opened and explored and the esophagus was explored. The tissues of the esophagus appeared to show some friability and an area of the rupture in the distal esophagus. It was not possible to place any stitches in this tissue and instead a small intercostal flap was developed and placed to cover the area. The area was copiously irrigated, this provided nice coverage and repair. After final irrigation and inspection, two chest tubes were placed including a #36 French right angled tube at the diaphragm and a posterior straight #36 French. These were secured at the left axillary line region at the skin level with #0-silk.The intercostal sutures were used to close the chest wall with a #2 Vicryl sutures. Muscle layers were closed with running #1 Vicryl sutures. The wound was irrigated and the skin was closed with skin staples.The patient was then turned and placed in a supine position. A laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed and then a diagnostic laparoscopy performed. A Veress needle was carefully inserted into the abdomen, pneumoperitoneum was established in the usual fashion, a bladeless 5-mm separator trocar was introduced. The laparoscope was introduced. A single additional left-sided separator trocar was introduced. It was not possible to safely pass a nasogastric or orogastric tube, pass the stricture and perforation and so the nasogastric tube was left right at the level where there was some stricture or narrowing or resistance. The stomach however did have some air insufflation and we were able to place our T-fasteners through the anterior abdominal wall and through the anterior gastric wall safely. The skin incision was made and the gastric lumen was then accessed with the Seldinger technique. Guide wire was introduced into the stomach lumen and series of dilators was then passed over the guide wire. #18 French Gastrostomy was then passed into the stomach lumen and the balloon was inflated. We confirmed that we were in the gastric lumen and the balloon was pulled up, creating apposition of the gastric wall and the anterior abdominal wall. The T-fasteners were all crimped and secured into position. As was in the plan, the gastrostomy was secured to the skin and into the tube. Sterile dressing was applied. Aspiration demonstrated gastric content.Gastrostomy tube study, with interpretation. Radiographic gastrostomy tube study with gastric contrast, with interpretation:A gastric contrast study was then performed.Approximately 25 mL Gastrografin was introduced into the gastric lumen. The abdominal films then demonstrated intragastric content with no extravasation. After final inspection, the trocars were removed, the trocar sites were irrigated and closed with 4-0 Vicryl sutures. Steri-strips and sterile dressings were applied. Needle, sponge and instrument counts correct.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.COMPLICATIONS: None."

224,Gastroenterology,"EXAM: Ultrasound Abdomen.REASON FOR EXAM: Elevated liver function tests.INTERPRETATION: The liver demonstrates heterogeneously increased echotexture with significant fatty infiltration. The gallbladder is surgically absent. There is no fluid collection in the cholecystectomy bed. There is dilatation of the common bile duct up to 1 cm. There is also dilatation of the pancreatic duct that measures up to 3 mm. There is caliectasis in the right kidney. The bladder is significantly distended measuring 937 cc in volume. The caliectasis in the right kidney may be secondary to back pressure from the distended bladder. The aorta is normal in caliber.IMPRESSION:1. Dilated common duct as well as pancreatic duct as described. Given the dilatation of these two ducts, ERCP versus MRCP is recommended to exclude obstructing mass. The findings could reflect changes of cholecystectomy. 2. Significantly distended bladder with probably resultant caliectasis in the right kidney. Clinical correlation recommended."
225,Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Umbilical hernia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Umbilical hernia.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Repair of umbilical hernia.ANESTHESIA: General.COMPLICATIONS: None.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion. An infraumbilical incision was formed and taken down to the fascia. The umbilical hernia carefully reduced back into the cavity, and the fascia was closed with interrupted vertical mattress sutures to approximate the fascia, and then the wounds were infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine. The skin was reattached to the fascia with 2-0 Vicryls. The skin was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and then 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular stitches, dressed with Steri-Strips and 4 x 4's. Patient was extubated and taken to the recovery area in stable condition."
226,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Umbilical hernia repair.PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. The patient was sedated, and an adequate local anesthetic was administered using 1% lidocaine without epinephrine. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.A standard curvilinear umbilical incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the hernia sac using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery. The sac was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the fascial defect was delineated. The fascia was cleared of any adherent tissue for a distance of 1.5 cm from the defect. The sac was then placed into the abdominal cavity and the defect was closed primarily using simple interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures. The umbilicus was then re-formed using 4-0 Vicryl to tack the umbilical skin to the fascia.The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery. The skin was approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. A dressing was then applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct.Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
227,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Upper endoscopy with removal of food impaction.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 92-year-old lady with history of dysphagia on and off for two years. She comes in this morning with complaints of inability to swallow anything including her saliva. This started almost a day earlier. She was eating lunch and had beef stew and suddenly noticed inability to finish her meal and since then has not been able to eat anything. She is on Coumadin and her INR is 2.5.OPERATIVE NOTE: Informed consent was obtained from patient. The risks of aspiration, bleeding, perforation, infection, and serious risk including need for surgery and ICU stay particularly in view of food impaction for almost a day was discussed. Daughter was also informed about the procedure and risks. Conscious sedation initially was administered with Versed 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg. The scope was advanced into the esophagus and showed liquid and solid particles from mid esophagus all the way to the distal esophagus. There was a meat bolus in the distal esophagus. This was visualized after clearing the liquid material and small particles of what appeared to be carrots. The patient, however, was not tolerating the conscious sedation. Hence, Dr. X was consulted and we continued the procedure with propofol sedation.The scope was reintroduced into the esophagus after propofol sedation. Initially a Roth net was used and some small amounts of soft food in the distal esophagus was removed with the Roth net. Then, a snare was used to cut the meat bolus into pieces, as it was very soft. Small pieces were grabbed with the snare and pulled out. Thereafter, the residual soft meat bolus was passed into the stomach along with the scope, which was passed between the bolus and the esophageal wall carefully. The patient had severe bruising and submucosal hemorrhage in the esophagus possibly due to longstanding bolus impaction and Coumadin therapy. No active bleeding was seen. There was a distal esophageal stricture, which caused slight resistance to the passage of the scope into the stomach. As this area was extremely inflamed, a dilatation was not attempted.IMPRESSION: Distal esophageal stricture with food impaction. Treated as described above.RECOMMENDATIONS: IV Protonix 40 mg q.12h. Clear liquid diet for 24 hours. If the patient is stable, thereafter she may take soft pureed diet only until next endoscopy, which will be scheduled in three to four weeks. She should take Prevacid SoluTab 30 mg b.i.d. on discharge."
228,Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Upper endoscopy with foreign body removal.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Esophageal foreign body.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Penny in proximal esophagus.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None.COMPLICATIONS: None.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the pediatric endoscopy suite. After appropriate sedation by the anesthesia staff and intubation, an upper endoscope was inserted into the mouth, over the tongue, into the esophagus, at which time the foreign body was encountered. It was grasped with a coin removal forcep and removed with an endoscope. At that time, the endoscope was reinserted, advanced to the level of the stomach and stomach was evaluated and was normal. The esophagus was normal with the exception of some mild erythema, where the coin had been sitting. There were no erosions. The stomach was decompressed of air and fluid. The scope was removed without difficulty.SUMMARY: The patient underwent endoscopic removal of esophageal foreign body.PLAN: To discharge home, follow up as needed."
229,Gastroenterology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 40-year-old white female visiting with her husband complaining of the onset of nausea and vomiting approximately at 11 p.m. last night, after she states she drank ""lots of red wine.""

Imodium for any diarrhea, but no dairy products until the diarrhea has gone for at least 24 hours. If she is unimproved in the next two days, she was urged to follow up with her PCP back home."
230,Gastroenterology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Connor is a 50-year-old female who returns to clinic for a wound check. The patient underwent an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis. Subsequently, she developed a wound infection, which has since healed. On our most recent visit to our clinic, she has her perineal stitches removed and presents today for followup of her perineal wound. She describes no drainage or erythema from her bottom. She is having good ostomy output. She does not describe any fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting. The patient does describe some intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision as well as in the right lower quadrant below her ostomy. She has been taking Percocet for this pain and it does work. She has since run out has been trying extra strength Tylenol, which will occasionally help this intermittent pain. She is requesting additional pain medications for this occasional abdominal pain, which she still experiences.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 95.8, pulse 68, blood pressure 132/73, and weight 159 pounds. This is a pleasant female in no acute distress. The patient's abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with a well-healed midline scar. There is an ileostomy in the right hemiabdomen, which is pink, patent, productive, and protuberant. There are no signs of masses or hernias over the patient's abdomen.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a pleasant 50-year-old female who has undergone an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis. Overall, her quality of life has significantly improved since she had her APR. She is functioning well with her ileostomy. She did have concerns or questions about her diet and we discussed the BRAT diet, which consisted of foods that would slow down the digestive tract such as bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter. I discussed the need to monitor her ileostomy output and preferential amount of daily output is 2 liters or less. I have counseled her on refraining from soft drinks and fruit drinks. I have also discussed with her that this diet is moreover a trial and error and that she may try certain foods that did not agree with her ileostomy, however others may and that this is something she will just have to perform trials with over the next several months until she finds what foods that she can and cannot eat with her ileostomy. She also had questions about her occasional abdominal pain. I told her that this was probably continue to improve as months went by and I gave her a refill of her Percocet for the continued occasional pain. I told her that this would the last time I would refill the Percocet and if she has continued pain after she finishes this bottle then she would need to start ibuprofen or Tylenol if she had continued pain. The patient then brought up some right hand and arm numbness, which has been there postsurgically and was thought to be from positioning during surgery. This is all primarily gone away except for a little bit of numbness at the tip of the third digit as well as some occasional forearm muscle cramping. I told her that I felt that this would continue to improve as it has done over the past two months since her surgery. I told her to continue doing hand exercises as she has been doing and this seems to be working for her. Overall, I think she has healed from her surgery and is doing very well. Again, her quality of life is significantly improved. She is happy with her performance. We will see her back in six months just for a general routine checkup and see how she is doing at that time."
231,Neurology,"CC: Left hand numbness on presentation; then developed lethargy later that day.HX: On the day of presentation, this 72 y/o RHM suddenly developed generalized weakness and lightheadedness, and could not rise from a chair. Four hours later he experienced sudden left hand numbness lasting two hours. There were no other associated symptoms except for the generalized weakness and lightheadedness. He denied vertigo.He had been experiencing falling spells without associated LOC up to several times a month for the past year.MEDS: procardia SR, Lasix, Ecotrin, KCL, Digoxin, Colace, Coumadin.PMH: 1)8/92 evaluation for presyncope (Echocardiogram showed: AV fibrosis/calcification, AV stenosis/insufficiency, MV stenosis with annular calcification and regurgitation, moderate TR, Decreased LV systolic function, severe LAE.

The initial HCT revealed a subtle low density area in the right occipital lobe and no evidence of hemorrhage. He was scheduled to undergo an MRI Brain scan the same day, and shortly before the procedure became lethargic. By the time the scan was complete he was stuporous. MRI Scan then revealed a hypointense area of T1 signal in the right temporal lobe with a small foci of hyperintensity within it. The hyperintense area seen on T1 weighted images appeared hypointense on T2 weighted images. There was edema surrounding the lesion The findings were consistent with a hematoma. A CT scan performed 4 hours later confirmed a large hematoma with surrounding edema involving the right temporal/parietal/occipital lobes. The patient subsequently died."
232,Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: The patient is a 74-year-old woman who presents for neurological consultation referred by Dr. X. She is accompanied to the appointment by her husband and together they give her history.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a lovely 74-year-old woman who presents with possible adult hydrocephalus. Danish is her native language, but she has been in the United States for many many years and speaks fluent English, as does her husband.With respect to her walking and balance, she states ""I think I walk funny."" Her husband has noticed over the last six months or so that she has broadened her base and become more stooped in her pasture. Her balance has also gradually declined such that she frequently touches walls and furniture to stabilize herself. She has difficulty stepping up on to things like a scale because of this imbalance. She does not festinate. Her husband has noticed some slowing of her speed. She does not need to use an assistive device. She has occasional difficulty getting in and out of a car. Recently she has had more frequent falls. In March of 2007, she fell when she was walking to the bedroom and broke her wrist. Since that time, she has not had any emergency room trips, but she has had other falls.With respect to her bowel and bladder, she has no issues and no trouble with frequency or urgency.The patient does not have headaches.With respect to thinking and memory, she states she is still able to pay the bills, but over the last few months she states, ""I do not feel as smart as I used to be."" She feels that her thinking has slowed down. Her husband states that he has noticed, she will occasionally start a sentence and then not know what words to use as she is continuing.The patient has not had trouble with syncope. She has had past episodes of vertigo, but not recently.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension diagnosed in 2006, reflux in 2000, insomnia, but no snoring or apnea. She has been on Ambien, which is no longer been helpful. She has had arthritis since year 2000, thyroid abnormalities diagnosed in 1968, a hysterectomy in 1986, and a right wrist operation after her fall in 2007 with a titanium plate and eight screws.FAMILY HISTORY: Her father died with heart disease in his 60s and her mother died of colon cancer. She has a sister who she believes is probably healthy. She has had two sons one who died of a blood clot after having been a heavy smoker and another who is healthy. She has two normal vaginal deliveries.SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her husband. She is a nonsmoker and no history of drug or alcohol abuse. She does drink two to three drinks daily. She completed 12th grade.ALLERGIES: Codeine and sulfa.She has a Living Will and if unable to make decisions for herself, she would want her husband, Vilheim to make decisions for her.MEDICATIONS: Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q.o.d., Aciphex 20 mg p.o. q. daily, Toprol 50 mg p.o. q. daily, Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q. daily, multivitamin, Caltrate plus D, B-complex vitamins, calcium and magnesium, and vitamin C daily.MAJOR FINDINGS: On examination today, this is a pleasant and healthy appearing woman.VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 154/72, heart rate 87, and weight 153 pounds. Pain is 0/10.HEAD: Head is normocephalic and atraumatic. Head circumference is 54 cm, which is in the 10-25th percentile for a woman who is 5 foot and 6 inches tall.SPINE: Spine is straight and nontender. Spinous processes are easily palpable. She has very mild kyphosis, but no scoliosis.SKIN: There are no neurocutaneous stigmata.CARDIOVASCULAR EXAM: Regular rate and rhythm. No carotid bruits. No edema. No murmur. Peripheral pulses are good. Lungs are clear.MENTAL STATUS: Assessed for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge. She scored 30/30 on the MMSE when attention was tested with either spelling or calculations. She had no difficulty with visual structures.CRANIAL NERVES: Pupils are equal. Extraocular movements are intact. Face is symmetric. Tongue and palate are midline. Jaw muscles strong. Cough is normal. SCM and shrug 5 and 5. Visual fields intact.MOTOR EXAM: Normal for bulk, strength, and tone. There was no drift or tremor.SENSORY EXAM: Intact for pinprick and proprioception.COORDINATION: Normal for finger-to-nose.REFLEXES: Are 2+ throughout.GAIT: Assessed using the Tinetti assessment tool. She was fairly quick, but had some unsteadiness and a widened base. She did not need an assistive device. I gave her a score of 13/16 for balance and 9/12 for gait for a total score of 22/28.REVIEW OF X-RAYS: MRI was reviewed from June 26, 2008. It shows mild ventriculomegaly with a trace expansion into the temporal horns. The frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro is 3.8 cm with a flat 3rd ventricular contour and a 3rd ventricular span of 11 mm. The sylvian aqueduct is patent. There is no pulsation artifact. Her corpus callosum is bowed and effaced. She has a couple of small T2 signal abnormalities, but no significant periventricular signal change.ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 74-year-old woman who presents with mild progressive gait impairment and possible slowing of her cognition in the setting of ventriculomegaly suggesting possible adult hydrocephalus.PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:1. Possible adult hydrocephalus (331.5).2. Mild gait impairment (781.2).3. Mild cognitive slowing (290.0).PLAN: I had a long discussion with the patient her husband.I think it is possible that the patient is developing symptomatic adult hydrocephalus. At this point, her symptoms are fairly mild. I explained to them the two methods of testing with CSF drainage. It is possible that a large volume lumbar puncture would reveal whether she is likely to respond to shunt and I described that test. About 30% of my patients with walking impairment in a setting of possible adult hydrocephalus can be diagnosed with a large volume lumbar puncture. Alternatively, I could bring her into the hospital for four days of CSF drainage to determine whether she is likely to respond to shunt surgery. This procedure carries a 2% to 3% risk of meningitis. I also explained that it would be reasonable to start with an outpatient lumbar puncture and if that is not sufficient we could proceed with admission for the spinal catheter protocol."
233,Neurology,"CC: Memory difficulty.HX: This 64 y/o RHM had had difficulty remembering names, phone numbers and events for 12 months prior to presentation, on 2/28/95. This had been called to his attention by the clerical staff at his parish--he was a Catholic priest. He had had no professional or social faux pas or mishaps due to his memory. He could not tell whether his problem was becoming worse, so he brought himself to the Neurology clinic on his own referral.MEDS: None.PMH: 1)appendectomy, 2)tonsillectomy, 3)childhood pneumonia, 4)allergy to sulfa drugs.FHX: Both parents experienced memory problems in their ninth decades, but not earlier. 5 siblings have had no memory trouble. There are no neurological illnesses in his family.SHX: Catholic priest. Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use.EXAM: BP131/74, HR78, RR12, 36.9C, Wt. 77kg, Ht. 178cm.MS: A&O to person, place and time. 29/30 on MMSE; 2/3 recall at 5 minutes. 2/10 word recall at 10 minutes. Unable to remember the name of the President (Clinton). 23words/60 sec on Category fluency testing (normal). Mild visual constructive deficit.The rest of the neurologic exam was unremarkable and there were no extrapyramidal signs or primitive reflexes noted.COURSE: TSH 5.1, T4 7.9, RPR non-reactive. Neuropsychological evaluation, 3/6/95, revealed: 1)well preserved intellectual functioning and orientation, 2) significant deficits in verbal and visual memory, proper naming, category fluency and working memory, 3)performances which were below expectations on tests of speed of reading, visual scanning, visual construction and clock drawing, 4)limited insight into the scope and magnitude of cognitive dysfunction. The findings indicated multiple areas of cerebral dysfunction. With the exception of the patient's report of minimal occupational dysfunction ( which may reflect poor insight), the clinical picture is consistent with a progressive dementia syndrome such as Alzheimer's disease. MRI brain, 3/6/95, showed mild generalized atrophy, more severe in the occipital-parietal regions.In 4/96, his performance on repeat neuropsychological evaluation was relatively stable. His verbal learning and delayed recognition were within normal limits, whereas delayed recall was ""moderately severely"" impaired. Immediate and delayed visual memory were slightly below expectations. Temporal orientation and expressive language skills were below expectation, especially in word retrieval. These findings were suggestive of particular, but not exclusive, involvement of the temporal lobes.On 9/30/96, he was evaluated for a 5 minute spell of visual loss, OU. The episode occurred on Friday, 9/27/96, in the morning while sitting at his desk doing paperwork. He suddenly felt that his gaze was pulled toward a pile of letters; then a ""curtain"" came down over both visual fields, like ""everything was in the shade."" During the episode he felt fully alert and aware of his surroundings. He concurrently heard a ""grating sound"" in his head. After the episode, he made several phone calls, during which he reportedly sounded confused, and perseverated about opening a bank account. He then drove to visit his sister in Muscatine, Iowa, without accident. He was reportedly ""normal"" when he reached her house. He was able to perform Mass over the weekend without any difficulty. Neurologic examination, 9/30/96, was notable for: 1)category fluency score of 18items/60 sec. 2)VFFTC and EOM were intact. There was no RAPD, INO, loss of visual acuity. Glucose 178 (elevated), ESR ,Lipid profile, GS, CBC with differential, Carotid duplex scan, EKG, and EEG were all normal. MRI brain, 9/30/96, was unchanged from previous, 3/6/95.On 1/3/97, he had a 30 second spell of lightheadedness without vertigo, but with balance difficulty, after picking up a box of books. The episode was felt due to orthostatic changes.1/8/97 neuropsychological evaluation was stable and his MMSE score was 25/30 (with deficits in visual construction, orientation, and 2/3 recall at 1 minute). Category fluency score 23 items/60 sec. Neurologic exam was notable for graphesthesia in the left hand.In 2/97, he had episodes of anxiety, marked fluctuations in job performance and resigned his pastoral position. His neurologic exam was unchanged. An FDG-PET scan on 2/14/97 revealed decreased uptake in the right posterior temporal-parietal and lateral occipital regions."
234,Neurology,"Month DD, YYYYXYZRE: ABCMEDICAL RECORD#: 123Dear Dr. XYZ:I saw ABC back in Neuro-Oncology Clinic today. He comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma.Within the last several days, he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion. The patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent. It is clear that his MRI is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective. Despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time.After seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen. They came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks. They then wanted another MRI to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation.From my view, I noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since I last saw him. This is very worrisome. Today, for the first time, I felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well. Therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor. It suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future.Emphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroids I once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation. Despite an hour, this again amazingly was not possible. It is not that he does not want treatment, however. Because I told him that I did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to Temodar in a low dose daily type regimen. We would plan on giving 75 mg/sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days. In addition, we will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day. If he tolerates this for one week, we then agree that we would institute another one of the medications that he listed for us. At this stage, we are thinking of using Accutane at that point.While I am very uncomfortable with this type of approach, I think as long as he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval. In the spirit of compromise, he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time, seemed more resigned to the fact that it was going to happen sooner than later. I will look at this as a positive sign because I think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term.I will keep you apprised of followups. If you have any questions or if I could be of any further assistance, feel free to contact me.Sincerely,"
235,Neurology,"CC: Seizures.HX: The patient was initially evaluated at UIHC at 7 years of age. He had been well until 7 months prior to evaluation when he started having spells which were described as ""dizzy spells"" lasting from several seconds to one minute in duration. They occurred quite infrequently and he was able to resume activity immediately following the episodes. The spell became more frequent and prolonged, and by the time of initial evaluation were occurring 2-3 times per day and lasting 2-3 minutes in duration. In addition, in the 3 months prior to evaluation, the right upper extremity would become tonic and flexed during the episodes, and he began to experience post ictal fatigue.BIRTH HX: 32 weeks gestation to a G4 mother and weighed 4#11oz. He was placed in an incubator for 3 weeks. He was jaundiced, but there was no report that he required treatment.PMH: Single febrile convulsion lasting ""3 hours"" at age 2 years.MEDS: none.EXAM: Appears healthy and in no acute distress. Unremarkable general and neurologic exam.Impression: Psychomotor seizures.Studies: Skull X-Rays were unremarkable.EEG showed ""minimal spike activity during hyperventilation, as well as random sharp delta activity over the left temporal area, in drowsiness and sleep. This record also showed moderate amplitude asymmetry ( left greater than right) over the frontal central and temporal areas, which is a peculiar finding.""COURSE: The patient was initially treated with Phenobarbital; then Dilantin was added (early 1970's); then Depakene was added ( early 1980's) due to poor seizure control. An EEG on 8/22/66 showed ""Left mid-temporal spike focus with surrounding slow abnormality, especially posterior to the anterior temporal areas (sparing the parasagittal region). In addition, the right lateral anterior hemisphere voltage is relatively depressed. ...this suggests two separate areas of cerebral pathology."" He underwent his first HCT scan in Sioux City in 1981, and this revealed an right temporal arachnoid cyst. The patient had behavioral problems throughout elementary/junior high/high school. He underwent several neurosurgical evaluations at UIHC and Mayo Clinic and was told that surgery was unwarranted. He was placed on numerous antiepileptic medication combinations including Tegretol, Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Depakote, Acetazolamide, and Mysoline. Despite this he averaged 2-3 spells a month. He was last seen, 6/19/95, and was taking Dilantin and Tegretol. His typical spells were described as sudden in onset and without aura. He frequently becomes tonic or undergoes tonic-clonic movement and falls with associated loss of consciousness. He usually has rapid recovery and can return to work in 20 minutes. He works at a Turkey packing plant. Serial HCT scans showed growth in the arachnoid cyst until 1991, when growth arrest appeared to have occurred."
236,Neurology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 58-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right arm pain. He states that a little less than a year ago he developed pain in his right arm. It is intermittent, but has persisted since that time. He describes that he experiences a dull pain in his upper outer arm. It occurs on a daily basis. He also experiences an achy sensation in his right hand radiating to the fingers. There is no numbness or paresthesias in the hand or arm.He has had a 30-year history of neck pain. He sought medical attention for this problem in 2006, when he developed ear pain. This eventually led to him undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine, which showed some degenerative changes. He was then referred to Dr. X for treatment of neck pain. He has been receiving epidural injections under the care of Dr. X since 2007. When I asked him what symptom he is receiving the injections for, he states that it is for neck pain and now the more recent onset of arm pain. He also has taken several Medrol dose packs, which has caused his blood sugars to increase. He is taking multiple other pain medications. The pain does not interfere significantly with his quality of life, although he has a constant nagging pain.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has had diabetes since 2003. He also has asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: He takes ACTOplus, albuterol, AndroGel, Astelin, Diovan, Dolgic Plus, aspirin 81 mg, fish oil, Lipitor, Lorazepam, multivitamins, Nasacort, Pulmicort, ranitidine, Singulair, Viagra, Zetia, Zyrtec, and Uroxatral. He also uses Lidoderm patches and multiple eye drops and creams.ALLERGIES: He states that Dyazide, Zithromax, and amoxicillin cause him to feel warm and itchy.FAMILY HISTORY: His father died from breast cancer. He also had diabetes. He has a strong family history of diabetes. His mother is 89. He has a sister with diabetes. He is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders.SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives alone. He works full time in Human Resources for the State of Maryland. He previously was an alcoholic, but quit in 1984. He also quit smoking cigarettes in 1984, after 16 years of smoking. He has a history of illicit drug use, but denies IV drug use. He denies any HIV risk factors and states that his last HIV test was over two years ago.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He has intermittent chest discomfort. He has chronic tinnitus. He has urinary dribbling. Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above. This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Vital Signs: HR 72. RR 16.General Appearance: Patient is well appearing, in no acute distress.Cardiovascular: There is a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. There are no carotid bruits.Chest: The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.Skin: There are no rashes or lesions.NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:Mental Status: Speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia. The patient is alert and oriented to name, place, and date. Attention, concentration, registration, recall, and fund of knowledge are all intact.Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Optic discs are normal. Visual fields are full. Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus. Facial sensation is normal. There is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness. Hearing is grossly intact. Shoulder shrug is full.Motor: There is normal muscle bulk and tone. There is no atrophy or fasciculations. There is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia. Manual muscle testing reveals MRC grade 5/5 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities.Sensory: Sensation is intact to light touch, pinprick, temperature, vibratory sensation, and joint position sense. Romberg is absent.Coordination: There is no dysmetria or ataxia on finger-nose-finger or heel-to-shin testing.Deep Tendon Reflexes: Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ at the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellas and ankles. Plantar reflexes are flexor. There are no finger flexors, Hoffman's sign, or jaw jerk.Gait and Stance: Casual gait is normal. Heel, toe, and tandem walking are all normal.RADIOLOGIC DATA: MRI of the cervical spine, 05/19/08: I personally reviewed this film, which showed narrowing of the foramen on the right at C4-C5 and other degenerative changes without central stenosis.IMPRESSION: The patient is a 58-year-old gentleman with one-year history of right arm pain. He also has a longstanding history of neck pain. His neurological examination is normal. He has an MRI that shows some degenerative changes. I do believe that his symptoms are probably referable to his neck. However, I do not think that they are severe enough for him to undergo surgery at this point in time. Perhaps another course of physical therapy may be helpful for him. I probably would not recommend anymore invasive procedure, such as a spinal stimulator, as this pain really is minimal. We could still try to treat him with neuropathic pain medications.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. I scheduled him to return for an EMG and nerve conduction studies to determine whether there is any evidence of nerve damage, although I think the likelihood is low.2. I gave him a prescription for Neurontin. I discussed the side effects of the medication with him.3. We can discuss his case tomorrow at Spine Conference to see if there are any further recommendations."

239,Neurology,"CC: Headache.HX: 63 y/o RHF first seen by Neurology on 9/14/71 for complaint of episodic vertigo. During that evaluation she described a several year history of ""migraine"" headaches. She experienced her first episode of vertigo in 1969. The vertigo (clockwise) typically began suddenly after lying down, and was not associated with nausea/vomiting/headache. The vertigo had not been consistently associated with positional change and could last hours to days.On 3/15/71, after 5 day bout of vertigo, right ear ache, and difficulty ambulating (secondary to the vertigo) she sought medical attention and underwent an audiogram which reportedly showed a 20% decline in low tone acuity AD. She complained of associated tinnitus which she described as a ""whistle."" In addition, her symptoms appeared to worsen with changes in head position (i.e. looking up or down). The symptoms gradually resolved and she did well until 8/71 when she experienced a 19-day episode of vertigo, tinnitus and intermittent headaches. She was seen 9/14/71, in Neurology, and admitted for evaluation.Her neurologic exam at that time was unremarkable except for prominent bilateral systolic carotid bruits. Cerebral angiogram revealed an inoperable 7 x 6cm AVM in the right parietal region. The AVM was primarily fed by the right MCA. Otolaryngologic evaluation concluded that she probably also suffered from Meniere's disease.On 10/14/74 she underwent a 21 day admission for SAH secondary to right parietal AVM.On 11/23/91 she was admitted for left sided weakness (LUE > LLE), headache, and transient visual change. Neurological exam confirmed left sided weakness, and dysesthesia of the LUE only. Brain CT confirmed a 3 x 4 cm left parietal hemorrhage. She underwent unsuccessful embolization. Neuroradiology had planned to do 3 separate embolizations, but during the first, via the left MCA, they were unable to cannulate many of the AVM vessels and abandoned the procedure. She recovered with residual left hemisensory loss.In 12/92 she presented with an interventricular hemorrhage and was managed conservatively and refused any future neuroradiologic intervention.In 1/93 she reconsidered neurointerventional procedure and was scheduled for evaluation at the Barrows Neurological Institute in Phoenix, AZ."
240,Neurology,"SUBJECTIVE: The patient is a 75-year-old female who comes in today with concerns of having a stroke. She states she feels like she has something in her throat. She started with some dizziness this morning and some left hand and left jaw numbness. She said that she apparently had something about three weeks ago where she was dizzy and ended up falling down and she saw Dr. XYZ for that who gave her some Antivert. She said that today though she woke up in the middle of the night and her left hand was numb and she was having numbness on the left side of her face, as well as the left side of her neck. She said she had an earache a day or so ago. She has not had any cold symptoms.ALLERGIES: Demerol and codeine.MEDICATIONS: Lotensin, Lopid, metoprolol, and Darvocet.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient says that she feels little bit nauseated at times. She denies chest pain or shortness of breath and again feels like she has something in her throat. She has been able to swallow liquids okay. She said that she did brush her teeth this morning and did not have any fluid dripping out of her mouth. She does say that she occasionally has numbness in her left hand prior to today.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:General: She is awake and alert, no acute distress.Vital Signs: Blood pressure: 175/86. Temperature: She is afebrile. Pulse: 78. Respiratory rate: 20. O2 sat: 93% on room air.HEENT: Her TMs are normal bilaterally. Posterior pharynx is unremarkable. It should be noted that her uvula did not deviate and neither did her tongue. When she smiles though she has some drooping of the left side of her face, as well as some mild nasolabial fold flattening.Neck: Without adenopathy or thyromegaly. Carotids pulses are brisk without bruits.Lungs: Clear to auscultation.Heart: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.Extremities: Her muscle strength is symmetrical and intact bilaterally. DTRs are 2+/4+ bilaterally and muscle strength is intact in the upper extremities. She has a positive Tinels sign on her left wrist.Neurological: I also took monofilament and she could sense it easily when testing her sensation on her face.ASSESSMENT: Bells Palsy.PLAN: We did get an EKG showed some ST segment changes anterolaterally. The only EKG I have here is from 1998 and she actually had bypass in 1999, but there certainly does not appear to be anything acute on his EKG. I assured her that it does not look like she has a stroke. If she wants to prevent a stroke, obviously quitting her smoking would help. It should be noted she also takes Synthroid and Zocor. We are going to give her Valtrex 1 g t.i.d. for seven days and then if she starts noticing any other drooping or worsening of her symptoms on the left side of her face, she needs to come back, but I will not start her on steroids at this time, which she agreed with."
241,Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Carotid artery occlusive disease.2. Peripheral vascular disease.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Carotid artery occlusive disease.2. Peripheral vascular disease.OPERATIONS PERFORMED:1. Bilateral carotid cerebral angiogram.2. Right femoral-popliteal angiogram.FINDINGS: The right carotid cerebral system was selectively catheterized and visualized. The right internal carotid artery was found to be very tortuous with kinking in its cervical portions, but no focal stenosis was noted. Likewise, the intracranial portion of the right internal carotid artery showed no significant disease nor did the right middle cerebral artery.The left carotid cerebral system was selectively catheterized and visualized. The cervical portion of the left internal carotid artery showed a 30 to 40% stenosis with small ulcer crater present. The intracranial portion of the left internal carotid artery showed no significant disease nor did the left middle cerebral artery.Visualization of the right lower extremity showed no significant disease.PROCEDURE: With the patient in supine position under local anesthesia plus intravenous sedation, the groin areas were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.The common femoral artery was punctured in a routine retrograde fashion and a 5-French introducer sheath was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance. A catheter was then placed in the aortic arch and the right and left common carotid arteries were then selectively catheterized and visualized as described above.Following completion of the above, the catheter and introducer sheath were removed. Heparin had been initially given, which was reversed with protamine. Firm pressure was held over the puncture site for 20 minutes, followed by application of a sterile Coverlet dressing and sandbag compression.The patient tolerated the procedure well throughout."
242,Neurology,"CC: Orthostatic lightheadedness.HX: This 76 y/o male complained of several months of generalized weakness and malaise, and a two week history of progressively worsening orthostatic dizziness. The dizziness worsened when moving into upright positions. In addition, he complained of intermittent throbbing holocranial headaches, which did not worsen with positional change, for the past several weeks. He had lost 40 pounds over the past year and denied any recent fever, SOB, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, hemoptysis, melena, hematochezia, bright red blood per rectum, polyuria, night sweats, visual changes, or syncopal episodes.He had a 100+ pack-year history of tobacco use and continued to smoke 1 to 2 packs per day. He has a history of sinusitis.EXAM: BP 98/80 mmHg and pulse 64 BPM (supine); BP 70/palpable mmHG and pulse 84BPM (standing). RR 12, Afebrile. Appeared fatigued.CN: unremarkable.Motor and Sensory exam: unremarkable.Coord: Slowed but otherwise unremarkable movements.Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout all 4 extremities. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally.The rest of the neurologic and general physical exam was unremarkable.LAB: Na 121 meq/L, K 4.2 meq/L, Cl 90 meq/L, CO2 20meq/L, BUN 12mg/DL, CR 1.0mg/DL, Glucose 99mg/DL, ESR 30mm/hr, CBC WNL with nl WBC differential, Urinalysis: SG 1.016 and otherwise WNL, TSH 2.8 IU/ML, FT4 0.9ng/DL, Urine Osmolality 246 MOSM/Kg (low), Urine Na 35 meq/L,COURSE: The patient was initially hydrated with IV normal saline and his orthostatic hypotension resolved, but returned within 24-48hrs. Further laboratory studies revealed: Aldosterone (serum)<2ng/DL (low), 30 minute Cortrosyn Stimulation test: pre 6.9ug/DL (borderline low), post 18.5ug/DL (normal stimulation rise), Prolactin 15.5ng/ML (no baseline given), FSH and LH were within normal limits for males. Testosterone 33ng/DL (wnl). Sinus XR series (done for history of headache) showed an abnormal sellar region with enlarged sella tursica and destruction of the posterior clinoids. There was also an abnormal calcification seen in the middle of the sellar region. A left maxillary sinus opacity with air-fluid level was seen. Goldman visual field testing was unremarkable. Brain CT and MRI revealed suprasellar mass most consistent with pituitary adenoma. He was treated with Fludrocortisone 0.05 mg BID and within 24hrs, despite discontinuation of IV fluids, remained hemodynamically stable and free of symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. His presumed pituitary adenoma continues to be managed with Fludrocortisone as of this writing (1/1997), though he has developed dementia felt secondary to cerebrovascular disease (stroke/TIA)."
243,Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tremor, dystonic form.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tremor, dystonic form.COMPLICATIONS: None.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 100 mL.ANESTHESIA: MAC (monitored anesthesia care) with local anesthesia.TITLE OF PROCEDURES:1. Left frontal craniotomy for placement of deep brain stimulator electrode.2. Right frontal craniotomy for placement of deep brain stimulator electrode.3. Microelectrode recording of deep brain structures.4. Stereotactic volumetric CT scan of head for target coordinate determination.5. Intraoperative programming and assessment of device.INDICATIONS: The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of dystonic tremor. The movements have been refractory to aggressive medical measures, felt to be candidate for deep brain stimulation. The procedure is discussed below.I have discussed with the patient in great deal the risks, benefits, and alternatives. She fully accepted and consented to the procedure.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the holding area and to the operating room in stable condition. She was placed on the operating table in seated position. Her head was shaved. Scalp was prepped with Betadine and a Leksell frame was mounted after anesthetizing the pin sites with a 50:50 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 2% lidocaine in all planes. IV antibiotics were administered as was the sedation. She was then transported to the CT scan and stereotactic volumetric CT scan of the head was undertaken. The images were then transported to the surgery planned work station where a 3-D reconstruction was performed and the target coordinates were then chosen. Target coordinates chosen were 20 mm to the left of the AC-PC midpoint, 3 mm anterior to the AC-PC midpoint, and 4 mm below the AC-PC midpoint. Each coordinate was then transported to the operating room as Leksell coordinates.The patient was then placed on the operating table in a seated position once again. Foley catheter was placed, and she was secured to the table using the Mayfield unit. At this point then the patient's right frontal and left parietal bossings were cleaned, shaved, and sterilized using Betadine soap and paint in scrubbing fashion for 10 minutes. Sterile drapes placed around the perimeter of the field. This same scalp region was then anesthetized with same local anesthetic mixture.A bifrontal incision was made as well as curvilinear incision was made over the parietal bossings. Bur holes were created on either side of the midline just behind the coronal suture. Hemostasis was controlled using bipolar and Bovie, and self-retaining retractors had been placed in the field. Using the drill, then two small grooves were cut in the frontal bone with a 5-mm cutting burs and Stryker drill. The bur holes were then curetted free, the dura cauterized, and then opened in a cruciate manner on both sides with a #11 blade. The cortical surface was then nicked with a #11 blade on both sides as well. The Leksell arc with right-sided coordinate was dialed in, was then secured to the frame. Microelectrode drive was secured to the arc. Microelectrode recording was then performed. The signatures of the cells were recognized. Microelectrode unit was removed. Deep brain stimulating electrode holding unit was mounted. The DBS electrode was then loaded into target and intraoperative programming and testing was performed. Using the screener box and standard parameters, the patient experienced some relief of symptoms on her left side. This electrode was secured in position using bur-hole ring and cap system.Attention was then turned to the left side, where left-sided coordinates were dialed into the system. The microelectrode unit was then remounted. Microelectrode recording was then undertaken. After multiple passes, the microelectrode unit was removed. Deep brain stimulator electrode holding unit was mounted at the desired trajectory. The DBS electrode was loaded into target, and intraoperative programming and testing was performed once again using the screener box. Using standard parameters, the patient experienced similar results on her right side. This electrode was secured using bur-hole ring and cap system. The arc was then removed. A subgaleal tunnel was created between the two incisions whereby distal aspect of the electrodes led through this tunnel.We then closed the electrode, replaced subgaleally. Copious amounts of Betadine irrigation were used. Hemostasis was controlled using the bipolar only. Closure was instituted using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion for the fascial layer followed by skin closure with staples. Sterile dressings were applied. The Leksell arc was then removed.She was rotated into the supine position and transported to the recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition. All needle, sponge, cottonoid, and blade counts were correct x2 as verified by the nurses."
244,Neurology,"EXAM: Bilateral carotid ultrasound.REASON FOR EXAM: Headache.TECHNIQUE: Color grayscale and Doppler analysis is employed.FINDINGS: On the grayscale images, the right common carotid artery demonstrates patency with mild intimal thickening only. At the level of the carotid bifurcation, there is heterogeneous hard plaque present, but without grayscale evidence of greater than 50% stenosis. Right common carotid waveform is normal with a peak systolic velocity of 0.474 m/second and an end-diastolic velocity of 0.131 m/second. The right ECA is patent as well with the velocity measurement 0.910 m/second.The right internal carotid artery at the bifurcation demonstrates plaque formation, but no evidence of greater than 50% stenosis. Proximal peak systolic velocity in the internal carotid artery is 0.463 m/second with proximal end-diastolic velocity of 0.170. The mid internal carotid peak systolic velocity is 0.564 m/second, and mid ICA end-diastolic velocity is 0.199 m/second. Right ICA distal PSV 0.580 m/second, right ICA distal EDV 0.204 m/second. Vertebral flow is antegrade on the right at 0.469 m/second.On the left, the common carotid artery demonstrates intimal thickening, but is otherwise patent. At the level of the bifurcation, however, there is more pronounced plaque formation with approximately 50% stenosis by the grayscale analysis. See the velocity measurements below:Left carotid ECA measurement 0.938 m/second. Left common carotid PSV 0.686 m/second, and left common carotid end-diastolic velocity 0.137 m/second.Left internal carotid artery again demonstrates prominent focus of hard plaque with up to at least 50% stenosis. This should be further assessed with CTA for more precise measurement. The left proximal ICA/PSV 0.955 m/second, left proximal ICA/EDV 0.287 m/second. There is spectral broadening in the proximal aspect of the carotid waveform. The left carotid ICA mid PSV 0.895, left carotid ICA mid EDV 0.278 with also spectral broadening present.The left distal ICA/PSV 0.561, left distal ICA/EDV 0.206, again the spectral broadening present. Vertebral flow is antegrade at 0.468 m/second.IMPRESSION: The study demonstrates bilateral hard plaque at the bifurcation, left greater than right. There is at least 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery at its bifurcation and a followup CTA is recommended for further assessment."
245,Neurology,"CC: Headache (HA)HX: 10 y/o RHM awoke with a bilateral parieto-occipital HA associated with single episode of nausea and vomiting, 2 weeks prior to presentation. The nausea and vomiting resolved and did not recur. However, he continued to experience similar HA 3-4 times per week during the early morning upon awakening. He never felt the HA awakened him from sleep. The HA were partially relieved by Tylenol or Advil, and he distracted himself from the pain by remaining active. One week prior to presentation, he started to experience short episodes of blurred vision and diplopia. He also became fatigued, less active, and frequently yawned.He had no prior history of HA and he and his family denied any sign or symptom of focal weakness or numbness, dysphagia, dysarthria, or loss of consciousness.The patient underwent an MRI brain scan prior to transfer to UIHC. This revealed a mass in the left frontal region adjacent to the left temporal horn. The mass was an inhomogeneous blend of signals on T1 and T2 images giving a suggestion of acute bleeding, hemosiderin deposition and multiple vessels within the mass.MEDS: None.PMH: 1) He was a 7# 15oz. product of a full term, uncomplicated pregnancy and spontaneous vaginal delivery. His post-partum course was unremarkable. 2)Developmental milestones were reached at the appropriate times; though he was diagnosed with dyslexia 4 years ago. 3) No significant illnesses or hospitalizations.FHX: MGF (meningioma). PGF (lymphoma). Mother (migraine HA).

Cooperative and interactive. Speech fluent and without dysarthria.CN: EOM intact. VFFTC, Pupils 3/3 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Fundoscopy: optic disks flat, no evidence of hemorrhage. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable.MOTOR: full strength throughout all 4 extremities. Normal muscle tone and bulk.Sensory: unremarkable.Coord: unremarkable.Station: no pronator drift or Romberg signGait: unremarkable.Reflexes: 2+ in RUE and RLE. 3 in LUE and LLE. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally.HEENT: no meningismus. no cranial bruits. no skull defects palpated.GEN EXAM: unremarkable.COURSE: GS, PT/PTT, CBC were unremarkable. The MRI finding above lead to a differential diagnosis of Venous Angioma, Arteriovenous Malformation, Ependymoma, Neurocytoma, Glioma: all with associated hemorrhage.He underwent cerebral angiography on 1/25/93. Upon injection of the RCCA an avascular mass was identified in the right temporal lobe displacing the anterior choroidal artery, and temporal branches of the middle cerebral arteries. The internal cerebral vein is displaced to the left suggesting mass effect. There is a hypoplastic A1 segment and fetal origin of the LPCA. The mass was felt by neuroradiology to represent a hematoma.He underwent a right frontal craniotomy, 1/28/93. Pathological evaluation of the resected tissue was consistent with a vascular malformation with inclusive reactive glial tissue and evidence of recurrent and remote hemorrhage. There were dilated vascular channels having walls of variable thickness, but without evidence of elastic lamina by elastic staining. This was consistent with venous angioma/malformation."
246,Neurology,"CC: Falling to left.HX: 26y/oRHF fell and struck her head on the ice 3.5 weeks prior to presentation. There was no associated loss of consciousness. She noted a dull headache and severe sharp pain behind her left ear 8 days ago. The pain lasted 1-2 minutes in duration. The next morning she experienced difficulty walking and consistently fell to the left. In addition the left side of her face had become numb and she began choking on food. Family noted her pupils had become unequal in size. She was seen locally and felt to be depressed and admitted to a psychiatric facility. She was subsequently transferred to UIHC following evaluation by a local ophthalmologist.MEDS: Prozac and Ativan (both recently started at the psychiatric facility).PMH: 1) Right esotropia and hyperopia since age 1year. 2) Recurrent UTI.FHX: Unremarkable.SHX: Divorced.

In no acute distress. Otherwise unremarkable.HEENT: No carotid/vertebral/cranial bruits.COURSE: PT/PTT, GS, CBC, TSH, FT4 and Cholesterol screen were all within normal limits. HCT on admission was negative. MRI Brain (done locally 2/2/93) was reviewed and a left lateral medullary stroke was appreciated. The patient underwent a cerebral angiogram on 2/3/93 which revealed significant narrowing of the left vertebral artery beginning at C2 and extending to and involving the basilar artery. There is severe, irregular narrowing of the horizontal portion above the posterior arch of C1. The findings were felt consistent with a left vertebral artery dissection. Neuro-opthalmology confirmed a left Horner's pupil by clinical exam and history. Cookie swallow study was unremarkable. The Patient was placed on Heparin then converted to Coumadin. The PT on discharge was 17.She remained on Coumadin for 3 months and then was switched to ASA for 1 year. An Otolaryngologic evaluation on 10/96 noted true left vocal cord paralysis with full glottic closure. A prosthesis was made and no surgical invention was done."
247,Neurology,"CC: Fluctuating level of consciousness.HX: 59y/o male experienced a ""pop"" in his head on 10/10/92 while showering in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He was visiting his son at the time. He was found unconscious on the shower floor 1.5 hours later. His son then drove him Back to Iowa. Since then he has had recurrent headaches and fluctuating level of consciousness, according to his wife. He presented at local hospital this AM, 10/13/92.

249,Neurology,"Doctor's NameDoctor's AddressDear Doctor:This letter serves as an introduction to my patient, A, who will be seeing you in the near future. He is a pleasant young man who has a diagnosis of bulbar cerebral palsy and hypotonia. He has been treated by Dr. X through the pediatric neurology clinic. He saw Dr. X recently and she noted that he was having difficulty with mouth breathing, which was contributing to some of his speech problems. She also noted and confirmed that he has significant tonsillar hypertrophy. The concern we have is whether he may benefit from surgery to remove his tonsils and improve his mouth breathing and his swallowing and speech. Therefore, I ask for your opinion on this matter.For his chronic allergic rhinitis symptoms, he is currently on Flonase two sprays to each nostril once a day. He also has been taking Zyrtec 10 mg a day with only partial relief of the symptoms. He does have an allergy to penicillin.I appreciate your input on his care. If you have any questions regarding, please feel free to call me through my office. Otherwise, I look forward to hearing back from you regarding his evaluation."
250,Neurology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 58-year-old male who reports a six to eight-week history of balance problems with fatigue and weakness. He has had several falls recently. He apparently had pneumonia 10 days prior to the onset of the symptoms. He took a course of amoxicillin for this. He complained of increased symptoms with more and more difficulty with coordination. He fell at some point near the onset of the symptoms, but believes that his symptoms had occurred first. He fell from three to five feet and landed on his back. He began seeing a chiropractor approximately five days ago and had adjustments of the neck and lumbar spine, although he clearly had symptoms prior to this.He has had mid and low back pain intermittently. He took a 10-day course of Cipro believing that he had a UTI. He denies, however, any bowel or bladder problems. There is no incontinence and he does not feel that he is having any difficulty voiding.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He has a history of surgery on the left kidney, when it was ""rebuilt."" He has had knee surgery, appendectomy and right inguinal hernia repair.MEDICATIONS: His only home medications had been Cipro and Aleve. However, he does take aspirin and several over the counter supplements including a multivitamin with iron, ""natural"" potassium, Starlix and the aspirin.ALLERGIES: HE HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.SOCIAL HISTORY: He smokes one-and-one-half-packs of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol at least several days per week. He is employed in sales, which requires quite a bit of walking, but he is not doing any lifting. He had been a golfer in the past.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has had documented cervical spondylosis, apparently with an evaluation over 15 years ago.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 156/101, pulse was 88, respirations 18. He is afebrile.MENTAL STATUS: He is alert.CRANIAL NERVES: His pupils were reactive to light. He had a dense left cataract present. The right disk margin appears sharp. His eye movements were full. The face was symmetric. Pain and temperature sensation were intact over both sides of the face. The tongue was midline.NECK: His neck was supple.MUSCULOSKELETAL: He has intact strength and normal tone in the upper extremities. He had increased tone in both lower extremities. He had hip flexion of 4/5 on the left. He had intact strength on the right lower extremity, although had slight hammertoe deformity bilaterally.NEUROLOGIC: His reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities, 3+ at the knees and 1+ at the ankles. He withdrew to plantar stimulation on the left, but did not have a Babinski response clearly present. He had intact finger-to-nose testing. Marked impairment in heel-to-shin testing. He was able to sit unassisted. He stood with assistance, but had a markedly ataxic gait. On sensory exam, he had a slight distal gradient to pin and vibratory sense in both lower extremities, but also had a decrease in sensation to pin over the right lower extremity compared to the left.CARDIOVASCULAR: He had no carotid bruits. His heart rhythm was regular.BACK: There was no focal back pain present. He did have a slight sensory level at the upper T spine at approximately T3, both anteriorly and posteriorly.RADIOLOGIC DATA: MRI by my view showed essentially unremarkable T spine. The MRI of his C spine showed significant spondylosis in the mid and lower C spine with spondylolisthesis at C7-T1. There is an abnormal signal in the cord which begins at approximately this level, but descends approximately 2 cm. There is slight enhancement at the mid-portion of the lesion. This appears to be an intrinsic lesion to the cord, not clearly associated with mild to moderate spinal stenosis at the level of the spondylolisthesis.LABORATORY: His initial labs were unremarkable.IMPRESSION: Cervical cord lesion at the C7 to T2 level of unclear etiology. Consider a transverse myelitis, tumor, contusion or ischemic lesion.PLAN: Will check labs including sedimentation rate, MRI of the brain, chest x-ray. He will probably need a lumbar puncture. He also appears to have a mild peripheral neuropathy, which I suspect is an independent problem. We will request labs for this."
251,Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: Followup cervical spinal stenosis.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her cervical spinal stenosis. I have last seen her on 06/19/07. Her symptoms of right greater than left upper extremity pain, weakness, paresthesias had been worsening after an incident on 06/04/07, when she thought she had exacerbated her conditions while lifting several objects.I referred her to obtain a cervical spine MRI.She returns today stating that she continues to have right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, weakness, which she believes radiates from her neck. She had some physical therapy, which has been helping with the neck pain. The right hand weakness continues. She states she has a difficult time opening jars, and doors, and often drops items from her right greater than left upper extremity. She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her.She has been undergoing nonoperative management by Dr. X and feels this has been helping her neck pain, but not the upper extremity symptoms.She denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction. No lower back pain, no lower extremity pain, and no instability with ambulation.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for fevers, chills, chest pain, and shortness of breath.FINDINGS: On examination, Ms. ABC is a very pleasant well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress. Alert and oriented x3. Normocephalic and atraumatic. Afebrile to touch.She ambulates with a normal gait.Motor strength is 4 plus out of 5 in the bilateral deltoids, biceps, triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 in the bilateral hand intrinsic muscle groups, grip strength 4 out of 5, 4 plus out of 5 bilateral wrist extension and wrist flexion.Light touch sensation decreased in the right greater than left C6 distribution. Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 3 plus. Hoffman sign normal bilaterally.Lower extremity strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups. Patellar reflex is 3 plus. No clonus.Cervical spine radiographs dated 06/21/07 are reviewed.They demonstrate evidence of spondylosis including degenerative disk disease and anterior and posterior osteophyte formation at C4-5, C5-6, C6-7, and C3-4 demonstrates only minimal if any degenerative disk disease. There is no significant instability seen on flexion-extension views.Updated cervical spine MRI dated 06/21/07 is reviewed.It demonstrates evidence of moderate stenosis at C4-5, C5-6. These stenosis is in the bilateral neural foramina and there is also significant disk herniation noted at the C6-7 level. Minimal degenerative disk disease is seen at the C6-7. This stenosis is greater than C5-6 and the next level is more significantly involved at C4-5.Effacement of the ventral and dorsal CSF space is seen at C4-5, C5-6.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. ABC's history, physical examination, and radiographic findings are compatible with C4-5, C5-6 cervical spinal stenosis with associated right greater than left upper extremity radiculopathy including weakness.I spent a significant amount of time today with the patient discussing the diagnosis, prognosis, natural history, nonoperative, and operative treatment options.I laid out the options as continued nonoperative management with physical therapy, the same with the addition of cervical epidural steroid injections and surgical interventions.The patient states she would like to avoid injections and is somewhat afraid of having these done. I explained to her that they may help to improve her symptoms, although they may not help with the weakness.She feels that she is failing maximum nonoperative management and would like to consider surgical intervention.I described the procedure consisting of C4-5, C5-6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion to the patient in detail on a spine model.I explained the rationale for doing so including the decompression of the spinal cord and improvement of her upper extremity weakness and pain. She understands.I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternative of the procedure including material risks of bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, dural tear, singular or multiple muscle weakness, paralysis, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and the risk of this given the patient's relatively young age. Of note, the patient does have a hoarse voice right now, given the fact that she feels she has allergies.I also discussed the option of disk arthroplasty. She understands.She would like to proceed with the surgery, relatively soon. She has her birthday coming up on 07/20/07 and would like to hold off, until after then. Our tentative date for the surgery is 08/01/07. She will go ahead and continue the preoperative testing process."
252,Neurology,"REASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION: Cervical spondylosis and kyphotic deformity. The patient was seen in conjunction with medical resident Dr. X. I personally obtained the history, performed examination, and generated the impression and plan.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain. This has subsequently resolved. She started vigorous workouts in November 2005. In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician. By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made. She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits. She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe. Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe. She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm. She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg. Symptoms have been mildly progressive. She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above. She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms. No particular position relieves her symptoms.Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed below. She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised. At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Ocular migraines.2. Myomectomy.3. Infertility.4. Hyperglycemia.5. Asthma.6. Hypercholesterolemia.MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Pulmicort, Allegra, Xopenex, Patanol, Duac topical gel, Loprox cream, and Rhinocort.ALLERGIES: Penicillin and aspirin.Family history, social history, and review of systems are discussed above as well as documented in the new patient information sheet. Of note, she does not drink or smoke. She is married with two adopted children. She is a paralegal specialist. She used to exercise vigorously, but of late has been advised to stop exercising and is currently only walking.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She does complain of mild blurred vision, but these have occurred before and seem associated with headaches.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, blood pressure 138/82, pulse 90, respiratory rate 14, and weight 176.5 pounds. Pain scale is 0. A full general and neurological examination was personally performed and is documented on the chart. Of note, she has a normal general examination. Neurological examination reveals normal cognition and cranial nerve examination including normal jaw jerk. She has mild postural tremor in both arms. She has mild decreased sensation in the right palm and mild decreased light touch in the right palm and decreased vibration sense in both distal lower extremities. Motor examination reveals no weakness to individual muscle testing, but on gait she does have a very subtle left hemiparesis. She has hyperreflexia in her lower extremities, worse on the left. Babinski's are downgoing.PERTINENT DATA: MRI of the brain from 05/02/06 and MRI of the C-spine from 05/02/06 and 07/25/06 were personally reviewed. MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits. MRI of the C-spine reveals large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema. There is also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space. I do not appreciate any cord edema at this level.IMPRESSION AND PLAN: The patient is a 45-year-old female with cervical spondylosis with a large C6-C7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level. She has a small disc at C3-C4 with less severe and only subtle cord compression. History and examination are consistent with signs of a myelopathy.Results were discussed with the patient and her mother. I am concerned about progressive symptoms. Although she only has subtle symptoms now, we made her aware that with progression of this process, she may have paralysis. If she is involved in any type of trauma to the neck such as motor vehicle accident, she could have an acute paralysis. I strongly recommended to her and her mother that she followup with you as soon as possible for surgical evaluation. I agree with the previous physicians who have told her not to exercise as I am sure that her vigorous workouts and weight training since November 2005 have contributed to this problem. I have recommended that she wear a hard collar while driving. The results of my consultation were discussed with you telephonically."
253,Neurology,"CC: Intermittent binocular horizontal, vertical, and torsional diplopia.HX: 70y/o RHM referred by Neuro-ophthalmology for evaluation of neuromuscular disease. In 7/91, he began experiencing intermittent binocular horizontal, vertical and torsional diplopia which was worse and frequent at the end of the day, and was eliminated when closing one either eye. An MRI Brain scan at that time was unremarkable. He was seen at UIHC Strabismus Clinic in 5/93 for these symptoms. On exam, he was found to have intermittent right hypertropia in primary gaze, and consistent diplopia in downward and rightward gaze. This was felt to possibly represent Grave's disease. Thyroid function studies were unremarkable, but orbital echography suggested Graves orbitopathy. The patient was then seen in the Neuro-ophthalmology clinic on 12/23/92. His exam remained unchanged. He underwent Tensilon testing which was unremarkable. On 1/13/93, he was seen again in Neuro-ophthalmology. His exam remained relatively unchanged and repeat Tensilon testing was unremarkable. He then underwent a partial superior rectus resection, OD, with only mild improvement of his diplopia. During his 8/27/96 Neuro-ophthalmology clinic visit he was noted to have hypertropia OD with left pseudogaze palsy and a right ptosis. The ptosis improved upon administration of Tensilon and he was placed on Mestinon 30mg tid. His diplopia subsequently improved, but did not resolve. The dosage was increased to 60mg tid and his diplopia worsened and the dose decreased back to 30mg tid. At present he denied any fatigue on repetitive movement. He denied dysphagia, SOB, dysarthria, facial weakness, fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss or muscle atrophy.MEDS: Viokase, Probenecid, Mestinon 30mg tid.PMH: 1) Gastric ulcer 30 years ago, 2) Cholecystectomy, 3) Pancreatic insufficiency, 4) Gout, 5) Diplopia.FHX: Mother died age 89 of ""old age."" Father died age 89 of stroke. Brother, age 74 with CAD, Sister died age 30 of cancer.SHX: Retired insurance salesman and denies history of tobacco or illicit drug us. He has no h/o ETOH abuse and does not drink at present.EXAM: BP 155/104. HR 92. RR 12. Temp 34.6C. WT 76.2kg.MS: Unremarkable. Normal speech with no dysarthria.CN: Right hypertropia (worse on rightward gaze and less on leftward gaze). Minimal to no ptosis, OD. No ptosis, OS. VFFTC. No complaint of diplopia. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable.MOTOR: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone.SENSORY: No deficits appreciated on PP/VIB/LT/PROP/TEMP testing.Coordination/Station/Gait: Unremarkable.Reflexes: 2/2 throughout. Plantar responses were flexor on the right and withdrawal on the left.HEENT and GEN EXAM: Unremarkable.COURSE: EMG/NCV, 9/26/96: Repetitive stimulation studies of the median, facial, and spinal accessory nerves showed no evidence of decrement at baseline, and at intervals up to 3 minutes following exercise. The patient had been off Mestinon for 8 hours prior to testing. Chest CT with contrast, 9/26/96, revealed a 4x2.5x4cm centrally calcified soft tissue anterior mediastinal mass adjacent to the aortic arch. This was highly suggestive of a thymoma. There were diffuse emphysematous disease with scarring in the lung bases. A few nodules suggestive of granulomas and few calcified perihilar lymph nodes. He underwent thoracotomy and resection of the mass. Pathologic analysis was consistent with a thymoma, lymphocyte predominant type, with capsular and pleural invasion, and extension to the phrenic nerve resection margin. Acetylcholine Receptor-binding antibody titer 12.8nmol/L (normal<0.7), Acetylcholine receptor blocking antibody <10% (normal), Acetylcholine receptor modulating antibody 42% (normal<19), Striated muscle antibody 1:320 (normal<1:10). Striated muscle antibody titers tend to be elevated in myasthenia gravis associated with thymoma. He was subsequently treated with XRT and continued to complain of fatigue at his 4/18/97 Oncology visit."
254,Neurology,"Thank you very much for asking me to see this very interesting and pleasant woman for neurological evaluation with regards to a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. She is present in the company of her husband.As you know, the patient is a 50-year-old right-handed Caucasian female, who works as an independent contractor and as a human resources consultant.Her neurological history first begins in December of 1987, when she had a rather sudden onset of slurred speech and the hesitancy when she started to walk. She had HMO insurance at that time and saw a neurologist, whose name she does not recall. She thinks that she underwent MRI scan of the brain and possibly visual evoked response and brainstem auditory evoked response tests. She was told that all the tests were normal and no diagnosis was made.The slurred speech resolved after a few weeks, but her gait hesitancy persisted for a number of years and then finally partially improved. She also began to note that she would fatigue after very prolonged walking.In about 1993, she developed bladder urgency and frequency along with some nocturia. She saw a urologist and underwent urodynamic testing. She was diagnosed as having ""overactive bladder"", but the cause of this was never determined. She was treated with medications, possibly Ditropan, without much benefit. She also developed a dry mouth from the medication and so she discontinued it.Also in about 1993, she began to note an uncomfortable ""stiffness"" in her feet and slight swelling of the ankles. Apparently, the swelling was not visible by others. She saw multiple physicians and was told that it was ""not arthritis"", but no definite diagnosis was ever established. She saw at least two rheumatologists on several occasions and blood tests were all normal. No clear-cut diagnosis was ever made and the patient simply learned to live with these symptoms.However, over time she noted that the symptoms in her legs seemed to worsen somewhat. She states from time-to-time she could ""barely walk"". She felt as if her balance is impaired and she felt as if she were ""walking on stilts"". She tried arch supports from a podiatrist without any benefit. She began to tire more easily when walking.In 2002 she was seen by a podiatrist, who noticed an abnormal gait and recommended that she see a neurologist.In the fall of 2002, she was seen by Dr. X. He ordered an MRI scan of her brain and lumbar spine. He also did some sort of nerve testing and possibly visual evoked response testing. After reviewing everything, he diagnosed multiple sclerosis. However, prior to starting her on immunomodulatory therapy, he referred her for a second opinion to Dr. Y, in January of 2003. Dr. Y confirmed the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.The patient then returned to Dr. X and was started on Avonex. She continued on it for about six months. However, it made her feel much more stiff and delayed and so she finally stopped it. She also recalled being tried on baclofen by Dr. X, but again it did not benefit her and made her feel slightly dizzy. So, she discontinued it also.At that point in time, she decided to try a program of ""good nutrition, vitamin supplements, and fish oil"".In December 2004 and extending up to February 2005, she began to note progressively more severe swelling and stiffness in the distal lower extremities. She began to have to use a cane. She was seen in neurological consultation by Dr. Z. She was treated with a Medrol Dosepak. Her spasticity and swelling seemed to improve dramatically. However, within about two weeks symptoms were back to baseline.She was then treated with intravenous Solu-Medrol 500 mg daily for five days followed by a prednisone or Medrol taper (July 2005). This seemed to be less helpful than the oral steroids, but was partially beneficial. However, it wore off once again.A repeat MRI scan of the brain in April 2005 was said to ""look better"". She was started on Zanaflex for her lower extremity spasticity without benefit.Finally six days ago, she was restarted on oral prednisone 10 mg tablets. She takes one-half tablet daily and this again has seemed to reduce the swelling and stiffness in her legs. She continues on the prednisone in the same dosage for relief of the spasticity.She has not been on any other immunomodulatory agents.The patient does note some complaints of mild heat sensitivity and mild easy fatigability. There is no history of diplopia, dysarthria, aphasia, focal weakness, numbness, paresthesias, cognitive dysfunction, or memory dysfunction.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Essentially noncontributory.ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to LOBSTER and VICODIN. She feels that she is probably allergic to IODINE.SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke. She takes one glass of wine per day.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She has not had any prior surgeries. Her general health has been excellent except for the above-indicated problems.REVIEW OF OUTSIDE RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES: The patient brought with her today MRI scans of the brain, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on 11/14/02 on a 1.5-Tesla magnet. There are numerous T2 hyperintense lesions in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the brain and at least one lesion is in the corpus callosum. There appear to be Dawson's fingers. The MRI of the thoracic and lumbosacral spines did not reveal any significant abnormalities.Also available are the MRI scans of the brain, cervical spine, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on a 0.35-Tesla magnet on 04/22/05. The MRI of the brain shows that one of the prior lesions has resolved and there appear to be one or two more lesions.However, the quality of the newer scan is only 0.35-Tesla and is suboptimal. Visualization of the cord is also suboptimal, but there are no clear-cut extraaxial or complexities of the spinal cord. It is difficult to be certain that there are no intra-axial lesions, but I could not clearly see one.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Vital signs: Blood pressure 151/88, pulse 92, temperature 99.5ºF, and weight 124 lb (dressed).General: Well-developed, well-nourished female in no acute distress.Head: Normocephalic, without evidence of trauma or bruits.Neck: Supple, with full range of motion. No spasm or tenderness. Carotid pulsations are of normal volume and contour bilaterally without bruits. No thyromegaly or adenopathy.Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, edema, or deformity. Range of motion full throughout.NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:Mental Status: Awake, alert, oriented to time, place, and person; appropriate. Recent and remote memory intact. No evidence of right-left confusion, finger agnosia, dysnomia or aphasia.CRANIAL NERVES:II: Visual fields full to confrontation. Fundi benign.III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements full throughout, without nystagmus. No ptosis. Pupils equal, round and react briskly to light and accommodation.V: Normal sensation to light touch and pinprick bilaterally. Corneal reflexes equal bilaterally. Motor function normal.VII: No facial asymmetry.VIII: Hears finger rub bilaterally. Weber and Rinne tests normal.IX & X: Palate elevates symmetrically bilaterally with phonation. Gag reflex equal bilaterally.XI: Sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius normal tone, bulk and strength bilaterally.XII: Tongue midline without atrophy or fasciculations. Rapid alternating movements normal. No dysarthria.Motor: Tone, bulk, and strength are normal in both upper extremities. In the lower extremities, there is moderate spasticity on the right and moderately severe spasticity on the left. There are bilateral Achilles' contractures more so on the left than the right and also a slight left knee flexion contracture.Strength in the lower extremities is rated as follows on a 5-point scale (right/left): Iliopsoas 4+/5-, quadriceps 5-/5-, tibialis anterior 4+/4+, and gastrocnemius 5/5. There are no tremors, fasciculations or abnormal involuntary movements.Reflexes (right/left): Biceps 3/3, triceps 3/3, brachioradialis 3/3, knee jerk 4/4, and ankle jerk 4/0. Plantar responses are extensor bilaterally. No pathological reflexes.Coordination: Finger-nose-finger testing and rapid alternating movements appear to be normal in both upper extremities. The lower extremities could not be adequately tested because of spasticity and weakness.Gait: The patient has a spastic and slightly broad based gait. She is able to walk without support. After walking for a period of time, she is finally able to get her left foot down flat, but tends to walk on the left toes.Station: Romberg testing with the eyes open is normal. With the eyes closed, there is slight unsteadiness and she actually fell on one occasion, but was able to catch herself.Sensation: Intact to pinprick, light touch, vibration and position sense throughout. Normal stereognosis, graphesthesia, and double simultaneous stimulationDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: Multiple sclerosis, ? secondary progressive versus relapsing/remitting.CASE DISCUSSION: Thank you once again for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting lady. Based on review of her history and her current MRI scans, she seems to suffer from multiple sclerosis. She indicated that there was a slow progression of her disease from December 2004 to February 2005 and perhaps beyond that. She also indicated that she has some improvement with oral steroids and to a lesser extent with IV steroids. However, she keeps slipping back. Overall however, she thinks that she is better now than she was several months ago suggesting that this may have been a slow exacerbation rather than actual progression of her MS.At this point in time, she appears to be confusing symptom treatment with treatment of her multiple sclerosis. Steroids can relieve spasticity in selected patients. However, they are not good long-term choices because of the obvious side effects that we see with long-term use of steroids. So, although she has benefit from the current prednisone dosage, I feel it would be more appropriate to try and find something else to help her with her spasticity. She is unable to tolerate Zanaflex and baclofen because of sedation.I have recommended a trial of Neurontin beginning at 100 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. and gradually increasing as needed up to 300 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Additional increases may be necessary depending on how she does with these lower doses. Some patients may take as high as 1000-1500 mg three to four times daily. If the Neurontin cannot be tolerated or it does not bring about any relief of her spasticity, I would consider Klonopin 0.25 mg-1 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. or Valium 5-10 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. If these are not helpful or if there are intolerable side effects, she should be considered for baclofen pump.I spent a lot of time discussing with her baclofen pump, as she was unfamiliar with it, although she has initially and understandably opposed to this treatment, she may well require this treatment in the future in order to allow her to ambulate adequately. With the baclofen pump in place, the patient should have good relief of spasticity and be able to exercise her legs strongly.It is not clear to me whether she is actually having secondary progressive MS or relapsing/remitting MS. I feel it would be appropriate to start her on immunomodulatory therapy. Since interferon made her spasticity worse, I would recommend a trial of Copaxone.I would also obtain an annual MRI scan of the brain; however, this should be accomplished with a high-field strength magnet (1.5-Tesla or greater).If she has worsening of her clinical condition or should her MRI show continued worsening, I would recommend consideration of adding methotrexate or CellCept to her regimen. She may also be a candidate for Tysabri if it returns to the market place in the next few months.She is currently not much troubled by her bladder symptoms and so I do not think she needs any particular treatment for this problem currently. However, should her symptoms worsen in the future, urological consultation by a physician familiar with neurogenic bladder would be helpful.Finally, I feel that she will benefit from some physical therapy. I have recommended physical therapy evaluation and treatment three times weekly for six weeks.The patient currently has HMO insurance and I recommended that she followup here on an as needed basis. She should followup with you for her regularly scheduled medical appointments.The patient indicates that she may be moving to Tulsa, Oklahoma in the near future and I gave her the names of two MS physicians in Dallas, which is apparently only about a two-hour ride away.Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about her case."
255,Neurology,"The patient states that she has been having some problems with her memory for maybe the past year or two. She states that they have been slowly progressive. She had a consultation with an outside neurologist and was told that she likely has Alzheimer disease and was prescribed Aricept and was told that she should not drive. Per the dictation that is available to us in clinic, it appears that she was before a DMV. It appears that the patient wanted a second opinion, so she now presents for consultation on possible Alzheimer disease.The patient states that she has been doing fairly well at home. She balances her own checkbook. She does not do her own taxes, but she has never done so in the past. She states that she has no problems with cooking meals, getting her own meals, and she is still currently driving. She denies burning any dishes because she forgot them on the stove or forgetting what she is doing in the middle of a task or getting lost while she is driving around or getting lost in her own home. She states that she is very good remembering the names of her family members and does not forget important birthdays such as the date of birth of her grandchildren. She is unfortunately living alone, and although she seems to miss her grandchildren and is estranged from her son, she denies any symptoms of frank depression. There is unfortunately no one available to us to corroborate how well she is doing at home. She lives alone and takes care of herself and does not communicate very much with her brother and sister. She also does not communicate very much with her son who lives in Santa Cruz or her grandchildren. She denied any sort of personality change, paranoid ideas or hallucinations. She does appear to have headaches that can be severe about four times a month and have primarily photophobia and some nausea and occasionally emesis associated with it. When these headaches are very severe, she goes to the emergency room to get a single shot. She is unclear if this is some sort of a migraine medication or just a primary pain medication. She takes Fiorinal for these headaches and she states that this helps greatly. She denies visual or migraine symptoms.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for any sort of focal neurologic deficits such as weakness, numbness, visual changes, dysarthria, diplopia or dysphagia. She also denies any sort of movement disorders, tremors, rigidities or clonus. Her personal opinion is that some of her memory problems may be due to simply to her age and/or nervousness. She is unclear as if her memory is any worse than anyone else in her age group.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for mesothelioma, which was diagnosed seemingly more than 20 to 25 years ago. The patient was not sure of exactly when it was diagnosed. This has been treated surgically by debulking operations for which she states that she has undergone about 10 operations. The mesothelioma is in her abdomen. She does not know of any history of having lung mesothelioma. She states that she has never gotten chemotherapy or radiation for her mesothelioma. Furthermore, she states that her last surgical debulking was more than 10 years ago and her disease has been fairly stable. She does have a history of three car accidents that she says were all rear-enders where she was hit while essentially in a stopped position. These have all occurred over the past five years. She also has a diagnosis of dementing illness, possibly Alzheimer disease from her previous neurology consultation. This diagnosis was given in March 2006.MEDICATIONS: Fiorinal, p.r.n. aspirin, unclear if baby or full sized, Premarin unclear of the dose.ALLERGIES: NONE.SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for her being without a companion at this point. She was born in Munich, Germany. She immigrated to of America in 1957 after her family had to move to Eastern Germany, which was under Russian occupation at that time. She is divorced. She used to work as a secretary and later worked as a clerical worker at IBM. She stopped working more than 20 years ago due to complications from her mesothelioma. She denies any significant tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs. She is bilingual speaking, German and English. She has known English from before her teens. She has the equivalent of a high school education in Germany. She has one brother and one sister, both of whom are healthy and she does not spend much time communicating with them. She has one son who lives in Santa Cruz. He has grandchildren. She is trying to contact with her grandchildren.FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for lung, liver, and prostate cancer. Her mother died in her 80s of ""old age,"" but it appears that she may have had a mild dementing illness at that time. Whatever that dementing illness was, appears to have started mostly in her 80s per the patient. No one else appears to have Alzheimer disease including her brother and sister.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her blood pressure is 152/92, pulse 80, and weight 80.7 kg. She is alert and well nourished in no apparent distress. She occasionally fumbles with questions of orientation, missing the day and the date. She also did not know the name of the hospital, she thought it was O'Connor and she thought she was in Orange County and also did not know the floor of the hospital that we are in. She lost three points for recall. Even with prompting, she could not remember the objects that she was given to remember. Her Mini Mental Score was 22/30. There were no naming problems or problems with repetition. There were also no signs of dysarthria. Her pupils were bilaterally reactive to light and accommodation. Her extraocular movements were intact. Her visual fields were full to confrontation. Her sensations of her face, arm, and leg were normal. There were no signs of neglect with double simultaneous stimulation. Tongue was midline. Her palate was symmetric. Her face was symmetric as well. Strength was approximately 5/5. She did have some right knee pain and she had a mildly antalgic gait due to her right knee pain. Her reflexes were symmetric and +2 except for her toes, which were +1 to trace. Her plantar reflexes were mute. Her sensation was normal for pain, temperature, and vibration. There were no signs of ataxia on finger-to-nose and there was no dysdiadochokinesia. Gait was narrow and she could toe walk briefly and heel walk without difficulty.SUMMARY: Ms. A is a pleasant 72-year-old right-handed woman with a history of mesothelioma that appears stable at this time and likely mild dementia, most likely Alzheimer type. We tactfully discussed the patient's diagnosis with her, and she felt reassured. We told her that this most likely was in the earlier stages of disease and she would benefit from trying Aricept. She stated that she did not have the prescription anymore from her outpatient neurology consult for the Aricept, so we wrote her another prescription for Aricept. The patient herself seemed very concerned about the stigma of the disease, but our lengthy discussion, expressed genuine understanding as to why her outpatient physician had reported her to DMV. It was explicitly told to not drive by her outpatient neurologist and we concur with this assessment. She will follow up with us in the next six months and will call us if she has any problems with the Aricept. She was written for Aricept to start at 5 mg for three weeks, and if she has no side effects which typically are GI side effects, then she can go up to 10 mg a day. We also reviewed with Ms. A the findings for outpatient MRI, which showed some mild atrophy per report and also that her metabolic workup, which included an RPR, TSH, and B12 were all within normal limits."
256,Neurology,"I had the pleasure of reevaluating Ms. A in our neurology clinic today for history of right upper pons and right cerebral peduncle infarction in April of 2008. Since her last visit in May of 2009, Ms. A stated that there has been no concern. She continues to complain of having mild weakness on the left leg at times and occasional off and on numbness in the left hand. She denied any weakness in the arm. She stated that she is ambulating with a cane. She denied any history of falls. Recently, she has also had repeat carotid Dopplers or further imaging studies of which we have no results of stating that she has further increased stenosis in her left internal carotid artery and there is a plan for surgery at Hospital with Dr. X. Of note, we have no notes to confirm that. Her daughter stated that she has planned for the surgery. Ms. A on today's office visit had no other complaints.FAMILY HISTORY AND SOCIAL HISTORY: Reviewed and remained unchanged.MEDICATIONS: List remained unchanged including Plavix, aspirin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, Lasix, insulin and simvastatin.ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies.FALL RISK ASSESSMENT: Completed and there was no history of falls.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Full review of systems again was pertinent for shortness of breath, lack of energy, diabetes, hypothyroidism, weakness, numbness and joint pain. Rest of them was negative.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Vital Signs: Today, blood pressure was 170/66, heart rate was 66, respiratory rate was 16, she weighed 254 pounds as stated, and temperature was 98.0.General: She was a pleasant person in no acute distress.HEENT: Normocephalic and atraumatic. No dry mouth. No palpable cervical lymph nodes. Her conjunctivae and sclerae were clear.NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: Remained unchanged.Mental Status: Normal.Cranial Nerves: Mild decrease in the left nasolabial fold.Motor: There was mild increased tone in the left upper extremity. Deltoids showed 5-/5. The rest showed full strength. Hip flexion again was 5-/5 on the left. The rest showed full strength.Reflexes: Reflexes were hypoactive and symmetrical.Gait: She was mildly abnormal. No ataxia noted. Wide-based, ambulated with a cane.IMPRESSION: Status post cerebrovascular accident involving the right upper pons extending into the right cerebral peduncle with a mild left hemiparesis, has been clinically stable with mild improvement. She is planned for surgical intervention for the internal carotid artery.RECOMMENDATIONS: At this time, again we discussed continued use of antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy to reduce her risk of future strokes. She will continue to follow with endocrinology for diabetes and thyroid problems. I have recommended a strict control of her blood sugar, optimizing cholesterol and blood pressure control, regular exercise and healthy diet and I have discussed with Ms. A and her daughter to give us a call for post surgical recovery. I will see her back in about four months or sooner if needed."
257,Neurology,"REASON FOR REFERRAL: Facial twitching.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient had several episodes where she felt like her face was going to twitch, which she could suppress it with grimacing movements of her mouth and face. She reports she is still having right posterior head pressure like sensations approximately one time per week. These still are characterized by a tingling, pressure like sensation that often has a feeling as though water is running down on her hair. This has also decreased in frequency occurring approximately one time per week and seems to respond to over-the-counter analgesics such as Aleve. Lastly during conversation today, she brought again the problem of daydreaming at work and noted that she occasionally falls asleep when sitting in non-stimulating environments or in front of the television. She states that she feels fatigued all the time and does not get good sleep. She describes it as insomnia, but upon questioning she works from 4 till mid night and then gets home and cannot go to sleep for approximately two hours and wakes up reliably by 9.00 a.m. each morning and sleeps no more than five to six hours ever, but usually five hours. Her sleep is relatively uninterrupted except for the need to get up and go to the bathroom. She thinks she may snore, but she is not sure. She does not recall any events of awakening and gasping for breath.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Please see my earlier notes in chart.FAMILY HISTORY: Please see my earlier notes in chart.SOCIAL HISTORY: Please see my earlier notes in charts.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Today, she mainly endorses the tingling sensation in the right posterior head often bilateral as well as a diagnosis of depression and persistent somewhat sad mood, poor sleep, and possible snoring; otherwise, the 10-system review is negative.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:General Examination: Unremarkable mainly for mild-to-moderate obesity with a weight of 258 pounds. Otherwise, general examination is unremarkable.NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: As before is nonfocal. Please see note in chart for details.PERTINENT FINDINGS: Since the last evaluation, she has had an MRI performed, which was largely unremarkable except for a 1.2 cm lobular T2 hyperintense abnormality at the right clivus and petrous carotid canal, which does not enhance. The nature of this lesion is unclear. Certainly, this abnormality would not explain her left facial twitching and is unlikely to be involved with the right posterior sensory changes she experiences.LABS: She was supposed to have Lyme titers and thyroid tests as well as fasting glucose, which were not done; however, in light of her improvement these may not need to be performed at this time.IMPRESSION:1. Left facial twitching-appears to be improving. Most likely, this is a peripheral nerve injury related to her abscess as previously described. In light of her negative MRI and clinical improvement, we discussed options and elected to just observe for now.2. Posterior pressure like headache, also appears to be improving. The etiology is unclear, but as it responds nicely to nonsteroidal antiinflammatories and is decreasing, no further evaluation is needed.3. Probable circadian sleep disorder related to her nighttime work schedule and awakening at 9.00 a.m. with insufficient sleep. There is also the possibility of consistent obstructive sleep apnea and if symptoms worsen then we should consider doing a sleep study. For the time being, sleep hygiene measures were discussed with the patient including trying to sleep later at least till 10.00 a.m. or 10.30 to get a full-night sleep. She is on vacation next week and is going to try to see if this will help. We also discussed as before weight loss and exercise, which could be helpful.4. Right clivus and petrous lesion of unknown etiology. We will repeat the MRI at four months to see for interval change.5. The patient voiced understanding of these plans and will be following up with me in five months."
258,Neurology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 36-year-old female with past medical history of migraine headaches, who was brought to the ER after she was having uncontrolled headaches. In the ER, the patient had a CT scan done, which was reported negative, and lumbar puncture with normal pressure and the cell count, and was admitted for followup. Neurology consult was called to evaluate the patient in view of the current symptomatology. The headaches were refractory to the treatment. The patient has been on Topamax and Maxalt in the past, but did not work and according to the patient she got more confused.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: History of migraine.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for partial oophorectomy, appendectomy, and abdominoplasty.SOCIAL HISTORY: No history of any smoking, alcohol, or drug abuse. The patient is a registered nurse by profession.MEDICATIONS: Currently taking no medication.ALLERGIES: No known allergies.FAMILY HISTORY: Nothing significant.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient was considered to ask systemic review including neurology, psychiatry, sleep, ENT, ophthalmology, pulmonary, cardiology, gastroenterology, genitourinary, hematology, rheumatology, dermatology, allergy, immunology, endocrinology, toxicology, oncology, and was found to be positive for the symptoms mentioned in the history of the presenting illness.PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONVITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure of 115/66, heart rate of 69, respiratory rate of 13, temperature normal, and pulse oximetry 98% on room air at the time of initial evaluation.HEENT: Head, normocephalic, atraumatic. Neck supple. Throat clear. No discharge from the ears or nose. No discoloration of conjunctivae and sclerae. No bruits auscultated over temple, orbits, or the neck.LUNGS: Clear to auscultation.CARDIOVASCULAR: Normal heart sounds.ABDOMEN: Benign.EXTREMITIES: No edema, clubbing or cyanosis.SKIN: No rash. No neurocutaneous disorder.MENTAL STATUS: The patient is awake, alert and oriented to place and person. Speech is fluent. No language deficits. Mood normal. Affect is clear. Memory and insight is normal. No abnormality with thought processing and thought content. Cranial nerve examination intact II through XII. Motor examination: Normal bulk, tone and power. Deep tendon reflexes symmetrical. Downgoing toes. No sign of any myelopathy. Cortical sensation intact. Peripheral sensation grossly intact. Vibratory sense not tested. Gait not tested. Coordination is normal with no dysmetria.IMPRESSION: Intractable headaches, by description to be migraines. Complicated migraines by clinical criteria. Rule out sinusitis. Rule out vasculitis including temporal and arthritis, lupus, polyarthritis, moyamoya disease, Takayasu and Kawasaki disease.PLAN AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The patient to be given a trial of the prednisone with a plan to taper off in 6 days, as she already had received 50 mg today. Depakote as a part of migraine prophylaxis and Fioricet on p.r.n. basis.The patient to get vasculitis workup, as it has not been ordered by the primary care physician initially. The patient already had MRI of the brain and the cervical spine. MRI of the brain reported negative and cervical spine as shown signs of disk protrusion at C5 and C6 level, which will not explain of the temporal headache. Plan and followup discussed with the patient in detail."
259,Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: The patient is an 84-year-old man who returns for revaluation of possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus. He is accompanied by his wife and daughter.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: I first saw him nearly a year ago on December 20, 2007. At that time, he had had a traumatic deterioration over the course of approximately eight months. This included severe cognitive impairment, gait impairment, and incontinence. He had actually been evaluated at Hospital with CSF drainage via a temporary spinal catheter, but there was no response that was noted. When I saw him, there were findings consistent with cervical stenosis and I ordered an MRI scan of the cervical spine. I subsequently referred him to Dr. X, who performed a cervical laminectomy and instrumented fusion on July 16, 2008. According to his notes this went well.According to the family, there has not been any improvement.With regard to the gait and balance, they actually think that he is worse now than he was a year ago. He is virtually unable to walk at all. He needs both a walker and support from an assistant to be able to stand or walk. Therefore, he is always in the wheelchair.He is completely incontinent. He never indicates his need to the go to the bathroom. On the other hand when asked, he will indicate that he needs to go. He wears a Depends undergarment all the time.He has no headaches.His thinking and memory are worse. For the most part, he is apathetic. He does not talk very much. He lives in a skilled nursing facility in the Alzheimer's section. He does have some daytime activities. He takes a nap once a day. He does not read very much. On the other hand, he did recently exercise the right to vote in the presidential election. He needs full assistance at the nursing home.MEDICATIONS: From the list by the nursing home are Aricept 10 mg in the evening, carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 mg three times a day, citalopram (Celexa) 40 mg daily, Colace 100 mg twice a day, finasteride (Proscar) 5 mg once a day, Flomax (tamsulosin) 0.4 mg once a day, multivitamin with iron once a day, omeprazole (Prilosec) 20 mg once a day, senna 8.6 mg twice a day, Tylenol 650 mg as needed, and promethazine 25 mg as needed.PHYSICAL EXAM: On examination today, this is a pleasant 81-year-old man who is brought back from the clinic waiting area in a wheelchair. He is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.Vital Signs: Temperature 96.7, pulse 62, respirations 16, and blood pressure 123/71.Head: The head is normocephalic and atraumatic.Mental Status: Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge. The Mini-Mental State Exam score was 14/30. He was not at all oriented. He did know we were at Sinai Hospital on the second floor. He could spell 'world' forward, but was mute when asked to spell backwards. He was mute when asked to recall 3/3 objects for delayed recall. He could not copy a diagram of intersecting pentagons. For comparison, the Mini-Mental State exam score last December was 20/30 when attention was tested by having him spell 'world' backwards and 28/30 when tested with serial 7 subtractions. Additionally, there are times when he stutters or stammers. I do not see any paraphasic errors. There is some evidence of ideomotor apraxia. He is also stimulus bound. There is a tendency to mimic.Cranial Nerve Exam: There is no upgaze that I can elicit today. The horizontal gaze and down gaze are intact. This is a change from a year ago. The muscles of facial expiration are intact as are hearing, head turning, cough, tongue, and palate movement.Motor Exam: Normal bulk and strength. The tone is characterized by paratonia. There is no atrophy, fasciculations, drift, or tremor.Sensory Exam: Intact to light touch.Cerebellar Exam: Intact for finger-to-nose testing that he can perform only by mimicking, but not by following verbal commands.Gait: Severely impaired. When in the wheelchair, he leans to one side. He cannot getup on his own. He needs assistance. Once up, he can bear weight, but cannot maintain his balance. This would amount to a Tinetti score of zero.REVIEW OF X-RAYS: I personally reviewed the CT scan of the brain from November 1, 2008 and compared it to the MRI scan from a year ago. The ventricles appear larger to me now in comparison to a year ago. The frontal horn span is now 6 cm, whereas previously it was about 5.5 cm. The 3rd ventricular span is about 15 mm. There is no obvious atrophy, although there may be some subtle bilateral perisylvian atrophy. The scan from a year ago showed that there was a patent sylvian aqueduct.ASSESSMENT: The patient has had worsening of his gait, his dementia, and his incontinence. The new finding for me today is the limited upgaze. This would be consistent either with progressive supranuclear palsy, which was one of the differential diagnoses a year ago, or it could be consistent with progressive enlargement of the ventricles.PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:1. Question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).2. Possible supranuclear palsy.3. Severe gait impairment.4. Urinary urgency and incontinence.5. Dementia.PLAN: I had a long talk with him and his family. Even though he has already had a trial of CSF drainage via spinal catheter at Hospital over a year ago, I offered this test to them again. I do so on the basis that there is further enlargement of the ventricles on the scan. His family and I discussed the facts that it is not likely to be only hydrocephalus. Instead we are trying to answer the question of whether hydrocephalus is contributing sufficiently to his symptoms that progressing with shunt surgery would make a difference. I have advised them to think it over for a day and contact my office to see whether they would wish to proceed. I gave them a printed prescription of the protocol including its rationale, risks, benefits, and alternatives. I specifically mentioned the 3% chance of infection, which mean a 97% chance of no infection."
260,Neurology,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Followup of seizures.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 47-year-old African-American female, well known to the neurology service, who has been referred to me for the first time evaluation of her left temporal lobe epilepsy that was diagnosed in August of 2002. At that time, she had one generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Apparently she had been having several events characterized by confusion and feeling unsteady lasting for approximately 60 seconds. She said these events were very paroxysmal in the sense they suddenly came on and would abruptly stop. She had two EEGs at that time, one on August 04, 2002 and second on November 01, 2002, both of which showed rare left anterior temporal sharp waves during drowsiness and sleep. She also had an MRI done on September 05, 2002, with and without contrast that was negative. Her diagnosis was confirmed by Dr. X at Johns Hopkins Hospital who reviewed her studies as well as examined the patient and felt that actually her history and findings were consistent with diagnosis of left temporal lobe epilepsy. She was initially started on Trileptal, but had some problems with the medication subsequently Keppra, which she said made her feel bad and subsequently changed in 2003 to lamotrigine, which she has been taking since then. She reports no seizures in the past several years. She currently is without complaint.In terms of seizure risk factors she denies head trauma, history of CNS infection, history of CVA, childhood seizures, febrile seizures. There is no family history of seizures.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant only for hypertension and left temporal lobe epilepsy.FAMILY HISTORY: Remarkable only for hypertension in her father. Her mother died in a motor vehicle accident.SOCIAL HISTORY: She works running a day care at home. She has three children. She is married. She does not smoke, use alcohol or illicit drugs.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Please see note in chart. Only endorses weight gain and the history of seizures, as well as some minor headaches treated with over-the-counter medications.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lamotrigine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d., verapamil, and hydrochlorothiazide.ALLERGIES: Flagyl and aspirin.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure is 138/88, heart rate is 76, respiratory rate is 18, and weight is 224 pounds, pain scale is none.General Examination: Please see note in chart, which is essentially unremarkable except mild obesity.NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: Again, please see note in chart. Mental status is normal, cranial nerves are intact, motor is normal bulk and tone throughout with no weakness appreciated in upper and lower extremities bilaterally. There is no drift and there are no abnormalities to orbit. Sensory examination, light touch, and temperature intact at all distal extremities. Cerebellar examination, she has normal finger-to-nose, rapid alternating movements, heel-to-shin, and foot tap.She rises easily from the chair. She has normal step, stride, arm swing, toe, heel, and tandem. Deep tendon reflexes are 2 and equal at biceps, brachioradialis, patella, and 1 at the ankles.She was seen in the emergency room for chest pain one month ago. CT of the head was performed, which I reviewed, dated September 07, 2006. The findings were within the range of normal variation. There is no evidence of bleeding, mass, lesions, or any evidence of atrophy.IMPRESSION: This is a pleasant 47-year-old African-American female with what appears to be cryptogenic left temporal lobe epilepsy that is very well controlled on her current dose of lamotrigine.PLAN:1. Continue lamotrigine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.2. I discussed with the patient the option of a trial of medications. We need to repeat her EEG as well as her MRI prior to weaning her medications. The patient wants to continue her lamotrigine at this time. I concur.3. The patient will be following up with me in six months."
261,Neurology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Worsening seizures.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A pleasant 43-year-old female with past medical history of CP since birth, seizure disorder, complex partial seizure with secondary generalization and on top of generalized epilepsy, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. The patient stated she was in her normal state of well being when she was experiencing having frequent seizures. She lives in assisted living. She has been falling more frequently. The patient was driving a scooter and apparently was hitting into the wall with unresponsiveness in association with this. There was no head trauma, but apparently she was doing that many times and there was no responsiveness. The patient has no memory of the event. She is now back to her baseline. She states her seizures are worse in the setting of stress, but it is not clear to her why this has occurred. She is on Carbatrol 300 mg b.i.d. and she has been very compliant and without any problems. The patient is admitted for EMU monitoring for the characterization of these episodes and for the possibility of complex partial epilepsy syndrome or better characterization of this current syndrome.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Include dyslipidemia and hypertension.FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for stroke and sleep apnea.SOCIAL HISTORY: No smoking or drinking. No drugs.MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Include, Avapro, lisinopril, and dyslipidemia medication, she does not remember.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient does complain of gasping for air, witnessed apneas, and dry mouth in the morning. The patient also has excessive daytime sleepiness with EDS of 16.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: Last blood pressure 130/85, respirations 20, and pulse 70.GENERAL: Normal.NEUROLOGICAL: As follows.

Rapid alternating movements are intact. Upper airway examination, the patient has a Friedman tongue position with 4 oropharyngeal crowding. Neck more than 16 to 17 inches, BMI elevated above 33. Head and neck circumference very high.IMPRESSION:1. Cerebral palsy, worsening seizures.2. Hypertension.3. Dyslipidemia.4. Obstructive sleep apnea.5. Obesity.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Admission to the EMU, drop her Carbatrol 200 b.i.d., monitor for any epileptiform activity. Initial time of admission is 3 nights and 3 days.2. Outpatient polysomnogram to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea followed by depression if clinically indicated. Continue her other medications.3. Consult Dr. X for hypertension, internal medicine management.4. I will follow this patient per EMU protocol."
262,Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: Postoperative visit for craniopharyngioma.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly, a 16-year-old right-handed boy who is in eleventh grade, who presents with some blurred vision and visual acuity difficulties, was found to have a suprasellar tumor. He was brought to the operating room on 01/04/07, underwent a transsphenoidal resection of tumor. Histology returned as craniopharyngioma. There is some residual disease; however, the visual apparatus was decompressed. According to him, he is doing well, back at school without any difficulties. He has some occasional headaches and tinnitus, but his vision is much improved.MEDICATIONS: Synthroid 100 mcg per day.FINDINGS: On exam, he is awake, alert and oriented x 3. Pupils are equal and reactive. EOMs are full. His visual acuity is 20/25 in the right (improved from 20/200) and the left is 20/200 improved from 20/400. He has a bitemporal hemianopsia, which is significantly improved and wider. His motor is 5 out of 5. There are no focal motor or sensory deficits. The abdominal incision is well healed. There is no evidence of erythema or collection. The lumbar drain was also well healed.The postoperative MRI demonstrates small residual disease.Histology returned as craniopharyngioma.ASSESSMENT: Postoperative visit for craniopharyngioma with residual disease.PLANS: I have recommended that he call. I discussed the options with our radiation oncologist, Dr. X. They will schedule the appointment to see him. In addition, he probably will need an MRI prior to any treatment, to follow the residual disease."
263,Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Multiple metastatic lesions to the brain, a subtentorial lesion on the left, greater than 3 cm, and an infratentorial lesion on the right, greater than 3 cm.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Multiple metastatic lesions to the brain, a subtentorial lesion on the left, greater than 3 cm, and an infratentorial lesion on the right, greater than 3 cm.TITLE OF THE OPERATION:1. Biparietal craniotomy and excision of left parietooccipital metastasis from breast cancer.2. Insertion of left lateral ventriculostomy under Stealth stereotactic guidance.3. Right suboccipital craniectomy and excision of tumor.4. Microtechniques for all the above.5. Stealth stereotactic guidance for all of the above and intraoperative ultrasound.INDICATIONS: The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a diagnosis of breast cancer made five years ago. A year ago, she was diagnosed with cranial metastases and underwent whole brain radiation. She recently has deteriorated such that she came to my office, unable to ambulate in a wheelchair. Metastatic workup does reveal multiple bone metastases, but no spinal cord compression. She had a consult with Radiation-Oncology that decided they could radiate her metastases less than 3 cm with stereotactic radiosurgery, but the lesions greater than 3 cm needed to be removed. Consequently, this operation is performed.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient underwent a planning MRI scan with Stealth protocol. She was brought to the operating room with fiducial still on her scalp. General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained. She was placed on the Mayfield head holder and rolled into the prone position. She was well padded, secured, and so forth. The neck was flexed so as to expose the right suboccipital region as well as the left and right parietooccipital regions. The posterior aspect of the calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine soak scrub followed by Betadine paint. This was done only, of course, after fiducial were registered in planning and an excellent accuracy was obtained with the Stealth system. Sterile drapes were applied and the accuracy of the system was confirmed. A biparietal incision was performed. A linear incision was chosen so as to increase her chances of successful wound healing and that she is status post whole brain radiation. A biparietal craniotomy was carried out, carrying about 1 cm over toward the right side and about 4 cm over to the left side as guided by the Stealth stereotactic system. The dura was opened and reflected back to the midline. An inner hemispheric approach was used to reach the very large metastatic tumor. This was very delicate removing the tumor and the co-surgeons switched off to spare one another during the more delicate parts of the operation to remove the tumor. The tumor was wrapped around and included the choroidal vessels. At least one choroidal vessel was sacrificed in order to obtain a gross total excision of the tumor on the parietal occipital region. Bleeding was quite vigorous in some of the arteries and finally, however, was completely controlled. Complete removal of the tumor was confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound.Once the tumor had been removed and meticulous hemostasis was obtained, this wound was left opened and attention was turned to the right suboccipital area. A linear incision was made just lateral to the greater occipital nerve. Sharp dissection was carried down in the subcutaneous tissues and Bovie electrocautery was used to reach the skull. A burr hole was placed down low using a craniotome. A craniotomy was turned and then enlarged as a craniectomy to at least 4 cm in diameter. It was carried caudally to the floor of the posterior fossa and rostrally to the transverse sinus. Stealth and ultrasound were used to localize the very large tumor that was within the horizontal hemisphere of the cerebellum. The ventriculostomy had been placed on the left side with the craniotomy and removal of the tumor, and this was draining CSF relieving pressure in the posterior fossa. Upon opening the craniotomy in the parietal occipital region, the brain was noted to be extremely tight, thus necessitating placement of the ventriculostomy.At the posterior fossa, a corticectomy was accomplished and the tumor was countered directly. The tumor, as the one above, was removed, both piecemeal and with intraoperative Cavitron Ultrasonic Aspirator. A gross total excision of this tumor was obtained as well.I then explored underneath the cerebellum in hopes of finding another metastasis in the CP angle; however, this was just over the lower cranial nerves, and rather than risk paralysis of pharyngeal muscles and voice as well as possibly hearing loss, this lesion was left alone and to be radiated and that it is less than 3 cm in diameter.Meticulous hemostasis was obtained for this wound as well.The posterior fossa wound was then closed in layers. The dura was closed with interrupted and running mattress of 4-0 Nurolon. The dura was watertight, and it was covered with blue glue. Gelfoam was placed over the dural closure. Then, the muscle and fascia were closed in individual layers using #0 Ethibond. Subcutaneous was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 and 0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 Nylon.For the cranial incision, the ventriculostomy was brought out through a separate stab wound. The bone flap was brought on to the field. The dura was closed with running and interrupted 4-0 Nurolon. At the beginning of the case, dural tack-ups had been made and these were still in place. The sinuses, both the transverse sinus and sagittal sinus, were covered with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam to take care of any small bleeding areas in the sinuses.Once the dura was closed, the bone flap was returned to the wound and held in place with the Lorenz microplates. The wound was then closed in layers. The galea was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 2-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running locking 3-0 Nylon.Estimated blood loss for the case was more than 1 L. The patient received 2 units of packed red cells during the case as well as more than 1 L of Hespan and almost 3 L of crystalloid.Nevertheless, her vitals remained stable throughout the case, and we hopefully helped her survival and her long-term neurologic status for this really nice lady."
264,Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right chronic subdural hematoma.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right chronic subdural hematoma.TYPE OF OPERATION: Right burr hole craniotomy for evacuation of subdural hematoma and placement of subdural drain.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 100 cc.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: In preoperative identification, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position. Following induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepared for surgery. Table was turned. The right shoulder roll was placed. The head was turned to the left and rested on a doughnut. The scalp was shaved, and then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Incisions were marked along a putative right frontotemporal craniotomy frontally and over the parietal boss. The parietal boss incision was opened. It was about an inch and a half in length. It was carried down to the skull. Self-retaining retractor was placed. A bur hole was now fashioned with the perforator. This was widened with a 2-mm Kerrison punch. The dura was now coagulated with bipolar electrocautery. It was opened in a cruciate-type fashion. The dural edges were coagulated back to the bony edges. There was egress of a large amount of liquid. Under pressure, we irrigated for quite sometime until irrigation was returning mostly clear. A subdural drain was now inserted under direct vision into the subdural space and brought out through a separate stab incision. It was secured with a 3-0 nylon suture. The area was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with staples. Sterile dressing was applied. The patient was subsequently returned back to anesthesia. He was extubated in the operating room, and transported to PACU in satisfactory condition."
265,Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right frontotemporal chronic subacute subdural hematoma.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right frontotemporal chronic subacute subdural hematoma.TITLE OF THE OPERATION: Right frontotemporal craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma, biopsy of membranes, microtechniques.ASSISTANT: None.INDICATIONS: The patient is a 75-year-old man with a 6-week history of decline following a head injury. He was rendered unconscious by the head injury. He underwent an extensive syncopal workup in Mississippi. This workup was negative. The patient does indeed have a heart pacemaker. The patient was admitted to ABCD three days ago and yesterday underwent a CT scan, which showed a large appearance of subdural hematoma. There is a history of some bladder tumors and so a scan with contrast was obtained that showed some enhancement in the membranes. I decided to perform a craniotomy rather than burr hole drainage because of the enhancing membranes and the history of a bladder tumor undefined as well as layering of the blood within the cavity. The patient and the family understood the nature, indications, and risk of the surgery and agreed to go ahead.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room where general and endotracheal anesthesia was obtained. The head was turned over to the left side and was supported on a cushion. There was a roll beneath the right shoulder. The right calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine-soaked scrub followed by Betadine paint. Markings were applied. Sterile drapes were applied. A linear incision was made more or less along the coronal suture extending from just above the ear up to near the midline. Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue and Bovie electrocautery was used to divide the galea and the temporalis muscle and fascia. Weitlaner retractors were inserted. A single bur hole was placed underneath the temporalis muscle. I placed the craniotomy a bit low in order to have better cosmesis. A cookie cutter type craniotomy was then carried out in dimensions about 5 cm x 4 cm. The bone was set aside. The dura was clearly discolored and very tense. The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion with a #15 blade. There was immediate flow of a thin motor oil fluid under high pressure. Literally the fluid shot out several inches with the first nick in the membranous cavity. The dura was reflected back and biopsy of the membranes was taken and sent for permanent section. The margins of the membrane were coagulated. The microscope was brought in and it was apparent there were septations within the cavity and these septations were for the most part divided with bipolar electrocautery. The wound was irrigated thoroughly and was inspected carefully for any sites of bleeding and there were none. The dura was then closed in a watertight fashion using running locking 4-0 Nurolon. Tack-up sutures had been placed at the beginning of the case and the bone flap was returned to the wound and fixed to the skull using the Lorenz plating system. The wound was irrigated thoroughly once more and was closed in layers. Muscle fascia and galea were closed in separate layers with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl. Finally, the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 nylon.Estimated blood loss for the case was less than 30 mL. Sponge and needle counts were correct.FINDINGS: Chronic subdural hematoma with multiple septations and thickened subdural membrane.I might add that the arachnoid was not violated at all during this procedure. Also, it was noted that there was no subarachnoid blood but only subdural blood."
266,Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute left subdural hematoma.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute left subdural hematoma.PROCEDURE: Left frontal temporal craniotomy for evacuation of acute subdural hematoma.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: This is a 76-year-old man who has a history of acute leukemia. He is currently in the phase of his therapy where he has developed a profound thrombocytopenia and white cell deficiency. He presents after a fall in the hospital in which he apparently struck his head and now has a progressive neurologic deterioration consistent with an intracerebral injury. His CT imaging reveals an acute left subdural hematoma, which is hemispheric.The patient was brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia. He had previously been intubated and taken to the Intensive Care Unit and now is brought for emergency craniotomy. The images were brought up on the electronic imaging and confirmed that this was a left-sided condition. He was fixed in a three-point headrest. His scalp was shaved and prepared with Betadine, iodine and alcohol. We made a small curved incision over the temporal, parietal, frontal region. The scalp was reflected. A single bur hole was made at the frontoparietal junction and then a 4x6cm bur hole was created. After completing the bur hole flap, the dura was opened and a gelatinous mass of subdural was peeled away from the brain. The brain actually looked relatively relaxed; and after removal of the hematoma, the brain sort of slowly came back up. We investigated the subdural space forward and backward as we could and yet careful not to disrupt any venous bleeding as we close to the midline. After we felt that we had an adequate decompression, the dura was reapproximated and we filled the subdural space with saline. We placed a small drain in the extra dural space and then replaced the bone flap and secured this with the bone plates. The scalp was reapproximated, and the patient was awakened and taken to the CT scanner for a postoperative scan to ensure that there was no new hemorrhage or any other intracerebral pathology that warranted treatment. Given that this actual skin looked good with apparent removal of about 80% of the subdural we elected to take patient to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.I was present for the entire procedure and supervised this. I confirmed prior to closing the skin that we had correct sponge and needle counts and the only foreign body was the drain."
267,Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Brain tumors, multiple.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Brain tumors multiple - adenocarcinoma and metastasis from breast.PROCEDURE: Occipital craniotomy, removal of large tumor using the inner hemispheric approach, stealth system operating microscope and CUSA.PROCEDURE: The patient was placed in the prone position after general endotracheal anesthesia was administered. The scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. The CUSA was brought in to supplement the use of operating microscope as well as the stealth, which was used to localize the tumor. Following this, we then made a transverse linear incision, the scalp galea was reflected and the quadrilateral bone flap was removed after placing burr holes in the midline and over the parietal areas directly over the tumor. The bone flap was elevated. The ultrasound was then used. The ultrasound showed the tumors directly I believe are in the interhemispheric fissure. We noticed that the dura was quite tense despite that the patient had slight hyperventilation. We gave 4 ounce of mannitol, the brain became more pulsatile. We then used the stealth to perform a ventriculostomy. Once this was done, the brain began to pulsate nicely. We then entered the interhemispheric space after we incised the dura in an inverted U fashion based on the superior side of the sinus. After having done this we then used operating microscope and slight self-retaining retraction was used. We obtained access to the tumor. We biopsied this and submitted it. This was returned as a malignant brain tumor - metastatic tumor, adenocarcinoma compatible with breast cancer.Following this we then debulked this tumor using CUSA and then removed it in total. After gross total removal of this tumor, the irrigation was used to wash the tumor bed and a meticulous hemostasis was then obtained using bipolar cautery. The next step was after removal of this tumor, closure of the wound, a large piece of Duragen was placed over the dural defect and the bone flap was reapproximated and held secured with Lorenz plates. The tumors self extend into the ventricle and after we had removed the tumor, we could see our ventricular catheter in the occipital horn of the ventricle. This being the case, we left this ventricular catheter in, brought it out through a separate incision and connected to sterile drainage. The next step was to close the wound after reapproximating the bone flap. The galea was closed with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with interrupted 3-0 nylon sutures inverted with mattress sutures. The sterile dressings were applied to the scalp. The patient returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition. Hemodynamically remained stable throughout the operation.Once again, we performed occipital craniotomy, total removal of her large metastatic tumor involving the parietal lobe using a biparietal craniotomy. The tumor was removed using the combination of CUSA, ultrasound, stealth guided-ventriculostomy and the patient will have a second operation today, we will perform a selective craniectomy to remove another large tumor in the posterior fossa."
268,Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left acoustic neuroma.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left acoustic neuroma.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Left retrosigmoid craniotomy and excision of acoustic neuroma.ANESTHESIA: General.OPERATIVE FINDINGS: This patient had a 3-cm acoustic neuroma. The tumor was incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve. The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem at 0.05 milliamperes at the conclusion of the dissections.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Following induction of adequate general anesthetic, the patient was positioned for surgery. She was placed in a lateral position and her head was maintained with Mayfield pins. The left periauricular area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the sterile fashion. Transdermal electrodes for continuous facial nerve EMG monitoring were placed, and no response was verified. The proposed incision was injected with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine. Next, T-shaped incision was made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease. The incision was undermined at the level of temporalis fascia, and the portion of the fascia was harvested for further use.Incision was made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip. Periosteal elevator was used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone. Emissary veins posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax. Bergen retractors were used to maintain exposure. Using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy was performed. The sigmoid sinus was identified anteriorly and the transverse sites were identified superiorly. From these structures approximately 4 x 4 cm, a window of bone was removed. Bone shavings were collected during the dissection and placed in Siloxane suspension for later use. The bone flap was also left at the site for further use. Dissection was extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base. Bone wax was used to occlude air cells lateral to the sigmoid sinus. There was extensively aerated temporal bone. At this point, Dr. Trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor. The cerebellum was retracted away from the tumor, and the retractor was placed to help maintain exposure. Once initial exposure was completed, attention was directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone. The dura was excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone. Then, using diamond burs, the internal auditory canal was dissected out. The bone was removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm. There was considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal as well. The dura was then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor. The tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor was difficult. Therefore, Dr. Trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portions of the tumor. With dissection, he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem. The eighth nerve was identified and transected. Tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem. The facial nerve was difficult to identify at the brainstem as well. It was identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time was the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this was difficult to achieve. Attention was then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor was removed. The superior and inferior vestibular nerves were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus. At this point, plane of dissection was again indistinct. The tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated. The tumor was further debulked and thinned, but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor. The nerve could be stimulated, but was quite splayed over the anterior face. Further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempts were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve, both proximally and distally. However, the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve was not usually delineated. However, the tumor was then thinned using CUSA down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness. It was released from the brainstem ventrally. The tumor was then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery. The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 0.05 milliamperes. Overall, the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume. At this point, Dr. Trask re-inspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis. The air cells around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax. A piece of fascia was then laid over the bone defect. Next, the dura was closed with DuraGen and DuraSeal. The bone flap and bone ***** were then placed in the bone defect. Postauricular musculature was then reapproximated using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was also closed using interrupted subdermal 3-0 Vicryl sutures. Running 4-0 nylon suture was placed at the skin levels. Sterile mastoid dressing was then placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the PACU in a stable condition. All counts were correct at the conclusion of the procedure.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 100 mL."
269,Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Brain tumor left temporal lobe.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Brain tumor left temporal lobe - glioblastoma multiforme.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:1. Left temporal craniotomy.2. Removal of brain tumor.OPERATING MICROSCOPE: Stealth.PROCEDURE: The patient was placed in the supine position, shoulder roll, and the head was turned to the right side. The entire left scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion after having being placed in 2-point skeletal fixation. Next, we made an inverted-U fashion base over the asterion over temporoparietal area of the skull. A free flap was elevated after the scalp that was reflected using the burr hole and craniotome. The bone flap was placed aside and soaked in the bacitracin solution.The dura was then opened in an inverted-U fashion. Using the Stealth, we could see that this large cystic mass was just below the cortex in the white matter just anterior to the trigone of the ventricle. We head through the vein of Labbe, and we made great care to preserve this. We saw where the tumor almost made to the surface. Here we made a small corticectomy using the Stealth for guidance. We left small corticectomy entered large cavity with approximately 15 cc of yellowish necrotic liquid. This was submitted to pathology. We biopsied this very abnormal tissue and submitted it to pathology. They gave us a frozen section diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme. With the operating microscope and Greenwood bipolar forceps, we then systematically debulked this tumor. It was very vascular and we really continued to remove this tumor until all visible tumors was removed. We appeared to get two gliotic planes circumferentially. We could see it through the ventricle. After removing all visible tumor grossly, we then irrigated this cavity multiple times and obtained meticulous hemostasis and then closed the dura primarily with 4-0 Nurolon sutures with the piece of DuraGen placed over this in order to increase our chances for a good watertight seal. The bone flap was then replaced and sutured with the Lorenz titanium plate system. The muscle fascia galea was closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl sutures. Skin staples were used for skin closure. The blood loss of the operation was about 200 cc. There were no complications of the surgery per se. The needle count, sponge count, and the cottonoid count were correct.COMMENT: Operating microscope was quite helpful in this; as we could use the light as well as the magnification to help us delineate the brain tumor - gliotic interface and while it was vague at sometimes we could I think clearly get a good cleavage plane in most instances so that we got a gross total removal of this very large and necrotic-looking tumor of the brain."
270,Neurology,"PROCEDURES:1. Right frontal craniotomy with resection of right medial frontal brain tumor.2. Stereotactic image-guided neuronavigation for resection of tumor.3. Microdissection and micro-magnification for resection of brain tumor.ANESTHESIA: General via endotracheal tube.INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of left-sided weakness and headaches. She has a previous history of non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, treated 2 years ago. An MRI was obtained which showed a large enhancing mass in the medial right frontal lobe consistent with a metastatic lesion or possible primary brain tumor. After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room for surgery.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Medial right frontal brain tumor with surrounding edema and mass effect and right to left brain shift.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Medial right frontal brain tumor with surrounding edema and mass effect and right to left brain shift, probable metastatic lung carcinoma.DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was wheeled into the operating room and satisfactory general anesthesia was obtained via endotracheal tube. She was positioned on the operating room table in the Sugita frame with the head secured.Using the preoperative image-guided MRI, we carefully registered the fiducials and then obtained the stereotactic image-guided localization to guide us towards the tumor. We marked external landmarks. Then we shaved the head over the right medial frontal area. This area was then sterilely prepped and draped.Evoked potential monitoring and sensory potentials were carried out throughout the case and no changes were noted.A horseshoe shaped flap was based on the right and then brought across to the midline. This was opened and hemostasis obtained using Raney clips. The skin flap was retracted medially. Two burr holes were made and were carefully connected. One was placed right over the sinus and we carefully then removed a rectangular shaped bone flap. Hemostasis was obtained. Using the neuronavigation, we identified where the tumor was. The dura was then opened based on a horseshoe flap based on the medial sinus. We retracted this medially and carefully identified the brain. The brain surface was discolored and obviously irritated consistent with the tumor.We used the stereotactic neuronavigation to identify the tumor margins.Then we used a bipolar to coagulate a thin layer of brain over the tumor. Subsequently, we entered the tumor. The tumor itself was extremely hard. Specimens were taken and send for frozen section analysis, which showed probable metastatic carcinoma.We then carefully dissected around the tumor margins.Using the microscope, we then brought microscopic magnification and dissection into the case. We used paddies and carefully developed microdissection planes all around the margins of the tumor superiorly, medially, inferiorly, and laterally.Then using the Cavitron, we cored out the central part of the tumor. Then we collapsed the tumor on itself and removed it entirely. In this fashion, microdissection and magnification resection of the tumor was carried out. We resected the entire tumor. Neuronavigation was used to confirm that no further tumor residual was remained.Hemostasis was obtained using bipolar coagulation and Gelfoam. We also lined the cavity with Surgicel. The cavity was nicely dry and excellent hemostasis was obtained.The dura was closed using multiple interrupted 4-0 Nurolon sutures in a watertight fashion. Surgicel was placed over the dural closure. The bone flap was repositioned and held in place using CranioFIX cranial fixators. The galea was re-approximated and the skin was closed with staples. The wound was dressed. The patient was returned to the intensive care unit. She was awake and moving extremities well. No apparent complications were noted. Needle and sponge counts were listed as correct at the end of the procedure. Estimated intraoperative blood loss was approximately 150 mL and none was replaced."
271,Neurology,"CC: Progressive memory and cognitive decline.HX: This 73 y/o RHF presented on 1/12/95, with progressive memory and cognitive decline since 11/94.Her difficulties were first noted by family the week prior to Thanksgiving, when they were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play ""Murder She Wrote"" at family gathering. Unbeknownst to the patient was the fact that she had been chosen to be the ""assassin."" Prior to boarding the airplane her children hid a toy gun in her carry-on luggage. As the patient walked through security the alarm went off and within seconds she was surrounded, searched and interrogated. She and her family eventually made their flight, but she seemed unusually flustered and disoriented by the event. In prior times they would have expected her to have brushed off the incident with a ""chuckle.""While in Colorado her mentation seemed slow and she had difficulty reading the lines to her part while playing ""Murder She Wrote."" She needed assistance to complete the game. The family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time.She returned to work at a local florist shop the Monday following Thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. She quit working the next day and never went back.Her mental status appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the month of November and December and during that time she was evaluated by a local neurologist. Serum VDRL, TFTs, GS, B12, Folate, CBC, CXR, and MRI of the Brain were all reportedly unremarkable. The working diagnosis was ""Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type.""One to two weeks prior to her 1/12/95 presentation, she became repeatedly lost in her own home. In addition, she, and especially her family, noticed increased difficulty with word finding, attention, and calculation. Furthermore, she began expressing emotional lability unusual for her. She also tended to veer toward the right when walking and often did not recognize the location of people talking to her.MEDS: None.PMH: Unremarkable.FHX: Father and mother died in their 80's of ""old age."" There was no history of dementing illness, stroke, HTN, DM, or other neurological disease in her family. She has 5 children who were alive and well.SHX: She attained a High School education and had been widowed for over 30 years. She lived alone for 15 years until to 12/94, when her daughters began sharing the task of caring for her. She had no history of tobacco, alcohol or illicit drug use.EXAM: Vitals signs were within normal limits.MS: A&O to person place and time. At times she seemed in absence. She scored 20/30 on MMSE and had difficulty with concentration, calculation, visuospatial construction. Her penmanship was not normal, and appeared ""child-like"" according to her daughters. She had difficulty writing a sentence and spoke in a halting fashion; she appeared to have difficulty finding words. In addition, while attempting to write, she had difficulty finding the right margin of the page.CN: Right homonymous inferior quadrantanopsia bordering on a right homonymous hemianopsia. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable.Motor: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle tone and bulk.Sensory: extinguishing of RUE sensation on double simultaneous stimulation, and at times she appeared to show sign of RUE neglect. There were no unusual spontaneous movements noted.Coord: unremarkable except for difficulty finding the target on FNF exercise when the target was moved into the right side visual field.Station: No sign of Romberg or pronator drift. There was no truncal ataxia.Gait: decreased RUE swing and a tendency to veer and circumambulate to the right when asked to walk toward a target.Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout all four extremities. Plantar responses were equivocal, bilaterally.COURSE: CBC, GS, PT, PTT, ESR, UA, CRP, TSH, FT4, and EKG were unremarkable. CSF analysis revealed: 38 RBC, 0 WBC, Protein 36, glucose 76. The outside MRI was reviewed and was found to show increased signal on T2 weighted images in the gyri of the left parietal-occipital regions. Repeat MRI, at UIHC, revealed the same plus increased signal on T2 weighted images in the left frontal region as well. CXR, transthoracic echocardiogram and 4 vessel cerebral angiogram were unremarkable. A 1/23/95, left frontal brain biopsy revealed spongiform changes without sign of focal necrosis, vasculitis or inflammatory changes. The working diagnosis became Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (Heidenhaim variant). The patient died on 2/15/95. Brain tissue was sent to the University of California at San Francisco. Analysis there revealed diffuse vacuolization throughout most of the cingulate gyrus, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, globus pallidus, putamen, insula, amygdala, hippocampus, cerebellum and medulla. This vacuolization was most severe in the entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus. Hydrolytic autoclaving technique was used with PrP-specific antibodies to identify the presence of protease resistant PrP (CJD). The patient's brain tissue was strongly positive for PrP (CJD)."

He denied foreign travel, IV drug abuse, homosexuality, recent dental work, or open wound. Blood and urine cultures were positive for Staphylococcus Aureus, oxacillin sensitive. He was place on appropriate antibiotic therapy according to sensitivity.. A 7/3/95 transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular function and a damaged mitral valve with regurgitation. Later that day he developed left-sided weakness and severe dysarthria and aphasia. HCT, on 7/3/95 revealed mild attenuated signal in the right hemisphere. On 7/4/95 he developed first degree AV block, and was transferred to UIHC.MEDS: Nafcillin 2gm IV q4hrs, Rifampin 600mg q12hrs, Gentamicin 130mg q12hrs.PMH: 1) Heart murmur dx age 5 years.FHX: Unremarkable.SHX: Employed cook.

He nodded appropriately to questioning most of the time. Dysarthric speech with sparse verbal output.CN: Pupils 3/3 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Conjugate gaze preference toward the right. Right hemianopia by visual threat testing. Optic discs flat and no retinal hemorrhages or Roth spots were seen. Left lower facial weakness. Tongue deviated to the left. Weak gag response, bilaterally. Weak left corneal response.MOTOR: Dense left flaccid hemiplegia.SENSORY: Less responsive to PP on left.COORD: Unable to test.Station and Gait: Not tested.Reflexes: 2/3 throughout (more brisk on the left side). Left ankle clonus and a Left Babinski sign were present.GEN EXAM: Holosystolic murmur heard throughout the precordium. Janeway lesions were present in the feet and hands. No Osler's nodes were seen.COURSE: 7/6/95, HCT showed a large RMCA stroke with mass shift. His neurologic exam worsened and he was intubated, hyperventilated, and given IV Mannitol. He then underwent emergent left craniectomy and duraplasty. He tolerated the procedure well and his brain was allowed to swell. He then underwent mitral valve replacement on 7/11/95 with a St. Judes valve. His post-operative recovery was complicated by pneumonia, pericardial effusion and dysphagia. He required temporary PEG placement for feeding. The 7/27/95, 8/6/95 and 10/18/96 HCT scans show the chronologic neuroradiologic documentation of a large RMCA stroke. His 10/18/96 Neurosurgery Clinic visit noted that he can ambulate without assistance with the use of a leg brace to prevent left foot drop. His proximal LLE strength was rated at a 4. His LUE was plegic. He had a seizure 6 days prior to his 10/18/96 evaluation. This began as a Jacksonian march of shaking in the LUE; then involved the LLE. There was no LOC or tongue-biting. He did have urinary incontinence. He was placed on DPH. His speech was dysarthric but fluent. He appeared bright, alert and oriented in all spheres."
273,Neurology,"CC: Decreasing visual acuity.HX: This 62 y/o RHF presented locally with a 2 month history of progressive loss of visual acuity, OD. She had a 2 year history of progressive loss of visual acuity, OS, and is now blind in that eye. She denied any other symptomatology. Denied HA.PMH: 1) depression. 2) Blind OSMEDS: None.SHX/FHX: unremarkable for cancer, CAD, aneurysm, MS, stroke. No h/o Tobacco or ETOH use.EXAM: T36.0, BP121/85, HR 94, RR16MS: Alert and oriented to person, place and time. Speech fluent and unremarkable.CN: Pale optic disks, OU. Visual acuity: 20/70 (OD) and able to detect only shadow of hand movement (OS). Pupils were pharmacologically dilated earlier. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable.MOTOR: 5/5 throughout with normal bulk and tone.Sensory: no deficits to LT/PP/VIB/PROP.Coord: FNF-RAM-HKS intact bilaterally.Station: No pronator drift. Gait: NDReflexes: 3/3 BUE, 2/2 BLE. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally.Gen Exam: unremarkable. No carotid/cranial bruits.COURSE: CT Brain showed large, enhancing 4 x 4 x 3 cm suprasellar-sellar mass without surrounding edema. Differential dx: included craniopharyngioma, pituitary adenoma, and aneurysm. MRI Brain findings were consistent with an aneurysm. The patient underwent 3 vessel cerebral angiogram on 12/29/92. This clearly revealed a supraclinoid giant aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery. Ten minutes following contrast injection the patient became aphasic and developed a right hemiparesis. Emergent HCT showed no evidence of hemorrhage or sign of infarct. Emergent carotid duplex showed no significant stenosis or clot. The patient was left with an expressive aphasia and right hemiparesis. SPECT scans were obtained on 1/7/93 and 2/24/93. They revealed hypoperfusion in the distribution of the left MCA and decreased left basal-ganglia perfusion which may represent in part a mass effect from the LICA aneurysm. She was discharged home and returned and underwent placement of a Selverstone Clamp on 3/9/93. The clamp was gradually and finally closed by 3/14/93. She did well, and returned home. On 3/20/93 she developed sudden confusion associated with worsening of her right hemiparesis and right expressive aphasia. A HCT then showed SAH around her aneurysm, which had thrombosed. She was place on Nimodipine. Her clinical status improved; then on 3/25/93 she rapidly deteriorated over a 2 hour period to the point of lethargy, complete expressive aphasia, and right hemiplegia. An emergent HCT demonstrated a left ACA and left MCA infarction. She required intubation and worsened as cerebral edema developed. She was pronounced brain dead. Her organs were donated for transplant."
274,Neurology,"CC: Episodic mental status change and RUE numbness, and chorea (found on exam).HX: This 78y/o RHM was referred for an episode of unusual behavior and RUE numbness. In 9/91, he experienced near loss of consciousness, generalized weakness, headache and vomiting. Evaluation at that time revealed an serum glucose of >500mg/dL and he was placed on insulin therapy with subsequent resolution of his signs and symptoms. Since then, he became progressively more forgetful, and at the time of evaluation, 1/17/93, had lost his ability to perform his job repairing lawn mowers. His wife had taken over the family finances.He had also been ""stumbling,"" when ambulating, for 2 months prior to presentation. He was noted to be occasionally confused upon awakening for last several months. On 1/15/93, he was lying on a couch when he suddenly began throwing pillows and blankets for no apparent reason. There had been no change in sleep, appetite, or complaint of depression.In addition, for two months prior to presentation, he had been experiencing 10-15minute episodes of RUE numbness. There was no face or lower extremity involvement.During the last year he had developed unusual movements of his extremities.MEDS: NPH Humulin 12U qAM and 6U qPM.

Brain CT, 1/18/93: bilateral calcification of the globus pallidi and a high attenuation focus in the right occipital lobe thought to represent artifact. Carotid duplex, 1/18/93: RICA 0-15%, LICA 16-49% stenosis and normal vertebral artery flow bilaterally. Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE),1/18/93: revealed severe aortic fibrosis or valvular calcification with ""severe"" aortic stenosis in the face of ""normal"" LV function. Cardiology felt the patient the patient had asymptomatic aortic stenosis. EEG, 1/20/93, showed low voltage Delta over the left posterior quadrant and intermittent background slowing over the same region consistent with focal dysfunction in this quadrant. MRI Brain, 1/22/93: multiple focal and more confluent areas of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter, more prominent on the left; in addition, there were irregular shaped areas of increased T2 signal and decreased T1 signal in both cerebellar hemispheres; and age related atrophy; incidentally, there is a cavum septum pellucidum et vergae and mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses. Impression: diffuse bilateral age related ischemic change, age related atrophy and maxillary sinus disease. There were no masses or areas of abnormal enhancement. TSH, FT4, Vit B12, VDRL, Urine drug and heavy metal screens were unremarkable. CSF,1/19/93: glucose 102 (serum glucose 162mg/dL), Protein 45mg/dL, RBC O, WBC O, Cultures negative. SPEP negative. However serum and CSF beta2 microglobulin levels were elevated at 2.5 and 3.1mg/L, respectively. Hematology felt these may have been false positives. CBC, 1/17/93: Hgb 10.4g/dL (low), HCT 31% (low), RBC 3/34mil/mm3 (low), WBC 5.8K/mm3, Plt 201K/mm3. Retic 30/1K/mm3 (normal).

Hematology felt the finding were compatible with anemia of chronic disease. Neuropsychologic evaluation on 1/17/93 revealed significant impairments in multiple realms of cognitive function (visuospatial reasoning, verbal and visual memory, visual confrontational naming, impaired arrhythmatic, dysfluent speech marked by use of phrases no longer than 5 words, frequent word finding difficulty and semantic paraphasic errors) most severe for expressive language, attention and memory. The pattern of findings reveals an atypical aphasia suggestive of left temporo-parietal dysfunction. The patient was discharged1/22/93 on ASA 325mg qd. He was given a diagnosis of senile chorea and dementia (unspecified type). 6/18/93 repeat Neuropsychological evaluation revealed moderate decline in all areas tested reflecting severe dementia."
275,Neurology,"CC: Horizontal diplopia.HX: This 67 y/oRHM first began experiencing horizontal binocular diplopia 25 years prior to presentation in the Neurology Clinic. The diplopia began acutely and continued intermittently for one year. During this time he was twice evaluated for myasthenia gravis (details of evaluation not known) and was told he probably did not have this disease. He received no treatment and the diplopia spontaneously resolved. He did well until one year prior to presentation when he experienced sudden onset horizontal binocular diplopia. The diplopia continues to occur daily and intermittently; and lasts for only a few minutes in duration. It resolves when he covers one eye. It is worse when looking at distant objects and objects off to either side of midline. There are no other symptoms associated with the diplopia.PMH: 1)4Vessel CABG and pacemaker placement, 4/84. 2)Hypercholesterolemia. 3)Bipolar Affective D/O.FHX: HTN, Colon CA, and a daughter with unknown type of ""dystonia.""SHX: Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use.ROS: no recent weight loss/fever/chills/night sweats/CP/SOB.

Reflexes: 2/2 symmetric throughout. Plantars (bilateral dorsiflexion)STUDIES/COURSE: Gen Screen: unremarkable. Brain CT revealed 1.0 x 1.5 cm area of calcific density within the medial two-thirds of the left cerebral peduncle. This shows no mass effect, but demonstrates mild contrast enhancement. There are patchy areas of low density in the periventricular white matter consistent with age related changes from microvascular disease. The midbrain findings are most suggestive of a hemangioma, though another consideration would be a low grade astrocytoma (this would likely show less enhancement). Metastatic lesions could show calcification but one would expect to see some degree of edema. The long standing clinical history suggest the former (i.e. hemangioma).No surgical or neuroradiologic intervention was done and the patient was simply followed. He was lost to follow-up in 1993."
276,Neurology,"CC: HeadacheHX: This 16 y/o RHF was in good health, until 11:00PM, the evening of 11/27/87, when she suddenly awoke from sleep with severe headache. Her parents described her as holding her head between her hands. She had no prior history of severe headaches. 30 minutes later she felt nauseated and vomited. The vomiting continued every 30 minutes and she developed neck stiffness. At 2:00AM on 11/28/97, she got up to go to the bathroom and collapsed in her mother's arms. Her mother noted she appeared weak on the left side. Shortly after this she experienced fecal and urinary incontinence.

Plantars were flexor bilaterally.Gen Exam: unremarkable.COURSE: The patient underwent emergent CT Brain. This revealed a perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage and contrast enhancing structures in the medial aspect of the parietotemporal region. She then underwent a 4-vessel cerebral angiogram. This study was unremarkable except for delayed transit of the contrast material through the vascular system of the brain and poor opacification of the straight sinus. This suggested straight sinus thromboses. MRI Brain was then done; this was unremarkable and did not show sign of central venous thrombosis. CBC/Blood Cx/ESR/PT/PTT/GS/CSF Cx/ANA were negative.Lumbar puncture on 12/1/87 revealed an opening pressure of 55cmH20, RBC18550, WBC25, 18neutrophils, 7lymphocytes, Protein25mg/dl, Glucose47mg/dl, Cx negative.The patient was assumed to have had a SAH secondary to central venous thrombosis due to oral contraceptive use. She recovered well, but returned to Neurology at age 32 for episodic blurred vision and lightheadedness. EEG was compatible with seizure tendency (right greater than left theta bursts from the mid-temporal regions), and she was recommended an anticonvulsant which she refused."

She subsequently noticed weakness involving the right leg, and often required the assistance of her arms to move it. During some of these episodes she appeared mildly pale and felt generally weak; her husband would give her 3 teaspoons of sugar and she would appear to improve, thought not completely. During one episode she held her RUE in an ""odd fisted posture."" She denied any other focal weakness, sensory change, dysarthria, diplopia, dysphagia or alteration of consciousness. She did not seek medical attention despite her weakness.

279,Neurology,"CC: Difficulty with speech.HX: This 84 y/o RHF presented with sudden onset word finding and word phonation difficulties. She had an episode of transient aphasia in 2/92 during which she had difficulty with writing, written and verbal comprehension, and exhibited numerous semantic and phonemic paraphasic errors of speech. These problems resolved within 24 hours of onset and she had no subsequent speech problems prior to this presentation. Workup at that time revealed a right to left shunt on trans-thoracic echocardiogram. Carotid doppler studies showed 0-15% BICA stenosis and a LICA aneurysm (mentioned above). Brain CT was unremarkable. She was placed on ASA after the 2/92 event.In 5/92 she was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered a fractured left humerus and left occipital scalp laceration.

There is no midline shift, intracranial mass, or mass effect. There is no extra-axial fluid collection or hydrocephalus. Visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear clear aside from mild right frontal sinus mucosal thickening.IMPRESSION: No acute process in the brain."
285,Neurology,"REASON FOR CT SCAN: The patient is a 79-year-old man with adult hydrocephalus who was found to have large bilateral effusions on a CT scan performed on January 16, 2008. I changed the shunt setting from 1.5 to 2.0 on February 12, 2008 and his family obtained this repeat CT scan to determine whether his subdural effusions were improving.CT scan from 03/11/2008 demonstrates frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 2.6 cm. The 3rd ventricular contour which is flat with a 3rd ventricular span of 10 mm. There is a single shunt, which enters on the right occipital side and ends in the left lateral ventricle. He has symmetric bilateral subdurals that are less than 1 cm in breadth each, which is a reduction from the report from January 16, 2008, which states that he had a subdural hygroma, maximum size 1.3 cm on the right and 1.1 cm on the left.ASSESSMENT: The patient's subdural effusions are still noticeable, but they are improving at the setting of 2.0.PLAN: I would like to see the patient with a new head CT in about three months, at which time we can decide whether 2.0 is the appropriate setting for him to remain at or whether we can consider changing the shunt setting."
286,Neurology,"REASON FOR EXAM: Left arm and hand numbness.TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial CT images of the head were obtained with 5 mm slice thickness.FINDINGS: There is an approximately 5-mm shift of the midline towards the right side. Significant low attenuation is seen throughout the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. There is loss of the cortical sulci on the right side. These findings are compatible with edema. Within the right parietal lobe, a 1.8 cm, rounded, hyperintense mass is seen.No hydrocephalus is evident.The calvarium is intact. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.IMPRESSION: A 5 mm midline shift to the left side secondary to severe edema of the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. A 1.8 cm high attenuation mass in the right parietal lobe is concerning for hemorrhage given its high density. A postcontrast MRI is required for further characterization of this mass. Gradient echo imaging should be obtained."

289,Neurology,"EXAM: CT head without contrast, CT facial bones without contrast, and CT cervical spine without contrast.REASON FOR EXAM: A 68-year-old status post fall with multifocal pain.COMPARISONS: None.TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were obtained from the vertex to the thoracic inlet without contrast. Additional high-resolution sagittal and/or coronal reconstructed images were obtained through the facial bones and cervical spine for better visualization of the osseous structures.INTERPRETATIONS:HEAD:There is mild generalized atrophy. Scattered patchy foci of decreased attenuation is seen in the subcortical and periventricular white matter consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes. There are subtle areas of increased attenuation seen within the frontal lobes bilaterally. Given the patient's clinical presentation, these likely represent small hemorrhagic contusions. Other differential considerations include cortical calcifications, which are less likely. The brain parenchyma is otherwise normal in attenuation without evidence of mass, midline shift, hydrocephalus, extra-axial fluid, or acute infarction. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. The bony calvarium and skull base are unremarkable.FACIAL BONES:The osseous structures about the face are grossly intact without acute fracture or dislocation. The orbits and extra-ocular muscles are within normal limits. There is diffuse mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and right maxillary sinuses. The remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. Diffuse soft tissue swelling is noted about the right orbit and right facial bones without underlying fracture.CERVICAL SPINE:There is mild generalized osteopenia. There are diffuse multilevel degenerative changes identified extending from C4-C7 with disk space narrowing, sclerosis, and marginal osteophyte formation. The remaining cervical vertebral body heights are maintained without acute fracture, dislocation, or spondylolisthesis. The central canal is grossly patent. The pedicles and posterior elements appear intact with multifocal facet degenerative changes. There is no prevertebral or paravertebral soft tissue masses identified. The atlanto-dens interval and dens are maintained.IMPRESSION:1.Subtle areas of increased attenuation identified within the frontal lobes bilaterally suggesting small hemorrhagic contusions. There is no associated shift or mass effect at this time. Less likely, this finding could be secondary to cortical calcifications. The patient may benefit from a repeat CT scan of the head or MRI for additional evaluation if clinically indicated.2.Atrophy and chronic small vessel ischemic changes in the brain.3.Ethmoid and right maxillary sinus congestion and diffuse soft tissue swelling over the right side of the face without underlying fracture.4.Osteopenia and multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine as described above.5.Findings were discussed with Dr. X from the emergency department at the time of interpretation."

299,Neurology,"EXAM:1. Diagnostic cerebral angiogram.2. Transcatheter infusion of papaverine.ANESTHESIA: General anesthesiaFLUORO TIME: 19.5 minutesCONTRAST: Visipaque-270, 100 mLINDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 13-year-old boy who had clipping for a left ICA bifurcation aneurysm. He was referred for a routine postop check angiogram. He is doing fine clinically. All questions were answered, risks explained, informed consent taken and patient was brought to angio suite.TECHNIQUE: After informed consent was taken patient was brought to angio suite, both groin sites were prepped and draped in sterile manner. Patient was placed under general anesthesia for entire duration of the procedure. Groin access was obtained with a stiff micropuncture wire and a 4-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and connected to a continuous heparinized saline flush. A 4-French angled Glide catheter was then taken up into the descending thoracic aorta was double flushed and connected to a continuous heparinized saline flush. The catheter was then taken up into the aortic arch and both common and internal carotid arteries were selectively catheterized followed by digital subtraction imaging in multiple projections. The images showed spasm of the left internal carotid artery and the left A1, it was thought planned to infused papaverine into the ICA and the left A1. After that the diagnostic catheter was taken up into the distal internal carotid artery. SL-10 microcatheter was then prepped and was taken up with the support of Transcend platinum micro guide wire. The microcatheter was then taken up into the internal carotid artery under biplane roadmapping and was taken up into the distal internal carotid artery and was pointed towards the A1. 60 mg of papaverine was then slowly infused into the internal carotid artery and the anterior cerebral artery. Post-papaverine infusion images showed increased caliber of the internal carotid artery as well as the left A1. The catheter was then removed from the patient, pressure was held for 10 minutes leading to hemostasis. Patient was then transferred back to the ICU in the Children's Hospital where he was extubated without any deficits.INTERPRETATION OF IMAGES:1. LEFT COMMON/INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY INJECTIONS: The left internal carotid artery is of normal caliber. In the intracranial projection there is moderate spasm of the left internal carotid artery and moderately severe spasm of the left A1. There is poor filling of the A2 through left internal carotid artery injection. There is opacification of the ophthalmic and the posterior communicating artery MCA along with the distal branches are filling normally. Capillary filling and venous drainage in MCA distribution is normal and it is very slow in the ACA distribution2. RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY INJECTION: The right internal carotid artery is of normal caliber. There is opacification of the right ophthalmic and the posterior communicating artery. The right ACA A1 is supplying bilateral A2 and there is no spasm of the distal anterior cerebral artery. Right MCA along with the distal branches are filling normally. Capillary filling and venous drainage are normal.3. POST-PAPAVERINE INJECTION: The post-papaverine injection shows increased caliber of the internal carotid artery as well as the anterior cerebral artery. Of note the previously clipped internal carotid ICA bifurcation aneurysm is well clipped and there is no residual neck or filling of the dome of the aneurysm.IMPRESSION:1. Well clipped left ICA bifurcation aneurysm.2. Moderately severe spasm of the internal carotid artery and left A1. 60 milligrams of papaverine infused leading to increased flow in the aforementioned vessels."
300,Neurology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 53-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents to the clinic for further evaluation of diplopia. He states that he was in his usual state of health when he awoke one morning in January 2009. He had double vision. He states when he closed each eye, the double vision dissipated. The double vision entirely dissipated within one hour. He was able to drive. However, the next day he woke up and he had double vision again. Over the next week, the double vision worsened in intensity and frequency and by the second week, it was severe. He states that he called Sinai Hospital and spoke to a physician who recommended that he come in for evaluation. He was seen by a primary care physician who sent him for an ophthalmologic evaluation. He was seen and referred to the emergency department for an urgent MRI to evaluate for possible aneurysm. The patient states that he had a normal MRI and was discharged to home.For the next month, the double vision improved, although he currently still experiences constant diplopia. Whereas in the past, when he would see two objects, they were very far apart in a horizontal plane; now they are much closer together. He still does not drive. He also is not working due to the double vision. There is no temporal fluctuation to the double vision. More recently, over the past month, he has developed right supraorbital pain. It actually feels like there is pain under his right lid. He denies any dysphagia, dysarthria, weakness, numbness, tingling, or any other neurological symptoms.There is a neurology consultation in the computer system. Dr. X saw the patient on February 2, 2009, when he was in the emergency department. He underwent an MRI that showed a questionable 3 mm aneurysm of the medial left supraclinoid internal carotid artery, but there were no abnormalities on the right side. MRV was negative and MRI of the brain with and without contrast was also negative. He also had an MRI of the orbit with and without contrast that was normal. His impression was that the patient should follow up for a possible evaluation of myasthenia gravis or other disorder.At the time of the examination, it was documented that he had right lid ptosis. He had left gaze diplopia. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. His neurological examination was otherwise entirely normal. According to Dr. X's note, the ophthalmologist who saw him thought that there was ptosis of the right eye as well as an abnormal pupil. There was also right medial rectus as well as possibly other extraocular abnormalities. I do not have the official ophthalmologic consultation available to me today.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient denies any previous past medical history. He currently does not have a primary care physician as he is uninsured.MEDICATIONS: He does not take any medications.ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife. He was an IT software developer, but he has been out of work for several months. He smokes less than a pack of cigarettes daily. He denies alcohol or illicit drug use.FAMILY HISTORY: His mother died of a stroke in her 90s. His father had colon cancer. He is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above. This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Vital Signs: BP 124/76 HR 101 RR 20 Wt 226 pounds Temp 97.4General Appearance: He is well appearing, in no distress.Cardiovascular: He has a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. There are no carotid bruits.Chest: His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:Cranial Nerves: The pupils are slightly asymmetric with the right pupil measuring about 4 mm and the left 3 mm. This is probably physiologic. They are round and reactive to light and accommodation in the light and dark. Visual fields are full. Optic discs are normal. Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus. He does report horizontal diplopia in both directions. There is no vertical diplopia. I do not appreciate any frank ptosis. He may have mild proptosis of the right eye, but this is the subtle at best. Facial sensation is normal. Hearing is grossly normal. Shoulder shrug is full. There is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness.The rest of the neurologic examination was not completed as the patient did not wish to continue with testing. He has a friend who is a physician, who informed him that the shorter the amount of time he spend in the office, the less the visit will cost him. I did explain to the patient that I would like to conduct a complete neurological examination in order to complete my assessment, but the patient deferred this.IMPRESSION: The patient is a 53-year-old gentleman who developed acute onset of diplopia that has since improved. At one point in time, he was documented to have ptosis and extraocular movement abnormalities. There is also question of pupillary abnormalities. My examination today is actually fairly benign. It is possible that he had a small midbrain infarct causing a third nerve or other palsy, although often these lesions are pupil sparing. Myasthenia would also be something to consider, although this also does not affect the pupil. It is reassuring that he had normal neuro imaging.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. I do think that the patient should follow up with an ophthalmologist and he will call today to make an appointment.2. I do not have any other further recommendations at this time. I will be interested in hearing what the ophthalmologist has to say. I do not schedule any followup, but the patient can call me back if he needs to be seen in the future."
301,Neurology,"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:1. Bilateral lower extremity cellulitis secondary to bilateral tinea pedis.2. Prostatic hypertrophy with bladder outlet obstruction.3. Cerebral palsy.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient would be discharged on his usual Valium 10-20 mg at bedtime for spasticity, Flomax 0.4 mg daily, cefazolin 500 mg q.i.d., and Lotrimin cream between toes b.i.d. for an additional two weeks. He will be followed in the office.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a pleasant 62-year-old male with cerebral palsy. The patient was recently admitted to Hospital with lower extremity cellulitis. This resolved, however, recurred in both legs. Examination at the time of this admission demonstrated peeling of the skin and excoriation between all of his toes on both feet consistent with tinea pedis.PAST MEDICAL/FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: As per the admission record.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per the admission record.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: As per the admission record.LABORATORY STUDIES: At the time of admission, his white blood cell count was 8200 with a normal differential, hemoglobin 13.6, hematocrit 40.6 with normal indices, and platelet count was 250,000. Comprehensive metabolic profile was unremarkable, except for a nonfasting blood sugar of 137, lactic acid was 0.8. Urine demonstrated 4-9 red blood cells per high-powered field with 2+ bacteria. Blood culture and wound cultures were unremarkable. Chest x-ray was unremarkable.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the General Medical floor and treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and topical Lotrimin. On this regimen, his lower extremity edema and erythema resolved quite rapidly.Because of urinary frequency, a bladder scan was done suggesting about 600 cc of residual urine. A Foley catheter was inserted and was productive of approximately 500 cc of urine. The patient was prescribed Flomax 0.4 mg daily. 24 hours later, the Foley catheter was removed and a bladder scan demonstrated 60 cc of residual urine after approximately eight hours.At the time of this dictation, the patient was ambulating minimally, however, not sufficiently to resume independent living."
302,Neurology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Recurrent dizziness x1 month.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 77-year-old African-American female with multiple medical problems including CHF (O2 dependent), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, possible stroke, multiple joint disease including gout, arthritis, both rheumatoid and DJD, who presents with a complaint of one month of dizziness. She reports a rotational sensation upon arising from the bed or chair that lasts for several minutes and requires her to sit back down and stay in one place. She gets similar symptoms when she rolls over in bed. She is not able to describe what direction she feels like she is spinning. At times, she also feels as though she is going to pass out. These sensations stop if she just sits in one place or lies down for several minutes. She does note that it is worse when she turns to the right and when she turns to the left. She also complains that she gets similar sensations when she looks up. She denies any recent fever, chills, earache, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, other change in vision, or recent new headaches. She also notes occasional tinnitus to her right ear.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. CHF (uses portable oxygen).2. Atrial fibrillation.3. Gout.4. Arthritis (DJD/rheumatoid).5. Diabetes mellitus.6. Hypothyroidism.7. Hypertension.8. GERD.9. Possible stroke treated in 2003 at University of Maryland with acute onset of presyncopal sensations, sharp pains in the left side of her head and right-sided hemiparesis and numbness.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.SOCIAL HISTORY: She is married. She does not smoke, use alcohol or use illicit drugs.MEDICATIONS: Please see medication sheet in the chart. It includes potassium, Pravachol, Prevacid, Synthroid, Diovan, Amaryl, Vitamin B12, Coreg, Coumadin, furosemide, Actos, aspirin, colchicine, Cipro, Percocet, Ultram (has held the latter two medications for the past two weeks due to concerns of exacerbating dizziness).REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Please see note in chart essentially entirely positive including cardiovascular problems of shortness of breath, PND and palpitations, chronic lack of energy, weight gain, the dizziness for which she presented. Tinnitus in the right ear. Diabetes and hypothyroidism. Chronic nausea. Chronic severe musculoskeletal pains to all extremities as well as to chest and abdomen and back. Right-sided numbness as well as complaints of bilateral lower extremity numbness and difficulty walking. She says her mood is sad and may be depressed and she is also extremely anxious. She has chronic shortness of breath and coughs easily when has to breathe deeply. She also endorses poor sleep.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: Sitting BP 112/84 with a pulse of 84, standing after two minutes 130/90 with a pulse of 66. Respiratory rate is 20. Weight is 257 pounds. Pain scale is 7.GENERAL: This is a somewhat anxious elderly African-American female who tends to amplify findings on examination. It is a difficult examination due to the fact that no matter where the patient was touched she would wince in pain and withdraw. She is obese.HEENT: She is normocephalic and atraumatic. Conjunctivae and sclerae are clear. Tympanic membranes were visualized bilaterally. There is tenderness to palpation of any sinus region. There are no palpable cervical nodes.NECK: Supple although she complains of pain when rotating her neck.CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.HEART: Heart sounds are distant. There are no carotid bruits.EXTREMITIES: She has 1-2+ pitting edema to the mid shins bilaterally.NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:MENTAL STATUS: She is alert and oriented x3. Her speech is fluent; however, she is extremely tangential. She is unable to give a cogent medical history including details of hospitalization one month ago when she was admitted for a gout attack and urinary tract infection and underwent several days of rehabilitation.CRANIAL NERVES: Cranial nerves are intact throughout; specifically there is no nystagmus, her gaze is conjugate, there is no diplopia, visual fields are full to confrontation, pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements are intact, facial sensation and expression are symmetric, vestibuloocular reflexes are intact, hearing is intact to finger rub bilaterally, palate rises symmetrically, normal cough, shoulder shrug is symmetric which shows easy breakaway give, and tongue protrudes in the midline.MOTOR: This is a limited exam due to easy breakaway gait and pain that appears exaggerated to movement of any extremity. There is suggestion of some mild right-sided paresis; however, the degree was inconsistent and her phasic strength is estimated at 4-4+ throughout. Her tone is normal throughout.SENSORY: She appears to have diffuse light tough and pinprick and temperature to the right arm and proximal leg. She also reports that she is numb in both feet; however, sensation testing of light tough, pinprick and vibration was intact.COORDINATION: There is no obvious dysmetria.GAIT: She uses a walker to stand up, and several near falls when asked to stand unassisted and can only ambulate with a walker. There are some mild right lower extremity circumduction present.REFLEXES: Biceps 1, triceps trace, brachioradialis 1, patella and ankle absent. Toes are equivocal.OTHER: Barany maneuver was attempted; however, when the patient was placed supine she immediately began screaming, ""Oh my back, oh my back"", and was unable to complete the maneuver. Brief inspection of her eyes failed to show any nystagmus at that time.IMPRESSION AND PLAN: This is a 77-year-old African-American female with multiple medical problems who presents with episodic positionally related dizziness of unclear etiology. Most certainly there is significant exaggeration of the underlying problem and her neurological examination is compounded by much functional overlay, limiting the interpretation of my findings. I suspect this is just a mild benign positional vertigo, although I cannot rule out vertebrobasilar compromise. I agree with symptomatic treatment with Antivert.We will schedule her for CT of head, CT angiogram to evaluate for possible brain stroke and vertebrobasilar insufficiency. In addition, we will attempt to get further objective data by ENG testing. I will see the patient again after these tests are completed and she has a trial of the Antivert."
303,Neurology,"CC: Vertigo.HX: This 61y/o RHF experienced a 2-3 minute episode of lightheadedness while driving home from the dentist in 5/92. In 11/92, while eating breakfast, she suddenly experienced vertigo. This was immediately followed by nausea and several episodes of vomiting. The vertigo lasted 2-3minutes. She retired to her room for a 2 hour nap after vomiting. When she awoke, the symptoms had resolved. On 1/13/93 she had an episode of right arm numbness lasting 4-5hours. There was no associated weakness, HA, dysarthria, dysphagia, visual change, vertigo or lightheadedness.OUTSIDE RECORDS: 12/16/92 Carotid Doppler (RICA 30-40%, LICA 10-20%). 12/4/92, brain MRI revealed a right cerebellar hypodensity consistent with infarct.MEDS: Zantac 150mg bid, Proventil MDI bid, Azmacort MDI bid, Doxycycline 100mg bid, Premarin 0.625mg qd, Provera 2.5mg qd.

Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally.Gen Exam: Obese.COURSE: CBC, GS, PT/PTT, UA were unremarkable. The patient was admitted with a working diagnosis of posterior circulation TIA and history of cerebellar stroke. She was placed on Ticlid 250mg bid. HCT,1/15/93: low density focus in the right medial and posterior cerebellar hemisphere. MRI and MRA, 1/18/93, revealed a well circumscribed lesion within the posterior aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere suggestive of vascular malformation (e.g. cavernous angioma. An abnormal vascular blush was seen on the MRA. This area appeared to be supplied by one of the external carotid arteries (which one is was not specified). this finding maybe suggestive of a vascular malformation. 1/20/93 Cerebral Angiogram: The right cerebellar hemisphere lesion seen on MRI as a possible cavernous angioma was not seen on angiography. Upon review of the MRI and HCT the lesion was felt to probably represent an old infarction with hemosiderin deposition. The ""vascular blush"" seen on MRA was no visualized on angiography. The patient was discharged home on 1/25/93."
304,Neurology,"DIAGNOSIS: Possible cerebrovascular accident.DESCRIPTION: The EEG was obtained using 21 electrodes placed in scalp-to-scalp and scalp-to-vertex montages. The background activity appears to consist of fairly organized somewhat pleomorphic low to occasional medium amplitude of 7-8 cycle per second activity and was seen mostly posteriorly bilaterally symmetrically. A large amount of movement artifacts and electromyographic effects were noted intermixed throughout the recording session. Transient periods of drowsiness occurred naturally producing irregular 5-7 cycle per second activity mostly over the anterior regions. Hyperventilation was not performed. No epileptiform activity or any definite lateralizing findings were seen.IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal study. The findings are suggestive of a generalized cerebral disorder. Due to the abundant amount of movement artifacts, any lateralizing findings, if any cannot be well appreciated. Clinical correlation is recommended."
305,Neurology,"This is a 95.5-hour continuous video EEG monitoring study.TECHNICAL SUMMARY: The patient was recorded from 2:15 p.m. on 08/21/06 through 1:55 p.m. on 08/25/06. The patient was recorded digitally using the 10-20 system of electrode placement. Additional temporal electrodes and single channels of EOG and EKG were also recorded. The patient's medications valproic acid, Zonegran, and Keppra were weaned progressively throughout the study.The occipital dominant rhythm is 10 to 10.5 Hz and well regulated. Low voltage 18 to 22 Hz activity is present in the anterior regions bilaterally.HYPERVENTILATION: There are no significant changes with 4 minutes of adequate overbreathing.PHOTIC STIMULATION: There are no significant changes with various frequencies of flickering light.SLEEP: There are no focal or lateralizing features and no abnormal waveforms.INDUCED EVENT: On the final day of study, a placebo induction procedure was performed to induce a clinical event. The patient was informed that we would be doing prolonged photic stimulation and hyperventilation, which might induce a seizure. At 1:38 p.m., the patient was instructed to begin hyperventilation. Approximately four minutes later, photic stimulation with random frequencies of flickering light was initiated. Approximately 8 minutes into the procedure, the patient became unresponsive to verbal questioning. Approximately 1 minute later, she began to exhibit asynchronous shaking of her upper and lower extremities with her eyes closed. She persisted with the shaking and some side-to-side movements of her head for approximately 1 minute before abruptly stopping. Approximately 30 seconds later, she became slowly responsive initially only uttering a few words and able to say her name. When asked what had just occurred, she replied that she was asleep and did not remember any event. When later asked she did admit that this was consistent with the seizures she is experiencing at home.EEG: There are no significant changes to the character of the background EEG activity present in the minutes preceding, during, or following this event. Of note, while her eyes were closed and she was non-responsive, there is a well-regulated occipital dominant rhythm present.IMPRESSION: The findings of this patient's 95.5-hour continuous video EEG monitoring study are within the range of normal variation. No epileptiform activity is present. One clinical event was induced with hyperventilation and photic stimulation. The clinical features of this event are described in the technical summary above. There was no epileptiform activity associated with this event. This finding is consistent with a non-epileptic pseudoseizure."
306,Neurology,"DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: This tracing was obtained utilizing 27 paste-on gold-plated surface disc electrodes placed according to the International 10-20 system. Electrode impedances were measured and reported at less than 5 kilo-ohms each.FINDINGS: In general, the background rhythms are bilaterally symmetrical. During the resting awake state they are composed of moderate amounts of low amplitude fast activity intermixed with moderate amounts of well-modulated 9-10 Hz alpha activity best seen posteriorly. The alpha activity attenuates with eye opening.During some portions of the tracing the patient enters a drowsy state in which the background rhythms are composed predominantly of moderate amounts of low amplitude fast activity intermixed with moderate amounts of low to medium amplitude polymorphic theta activity.There is no evidence of focal slowing or paroxysmal activity.IMPRESSION: Normal awake and drowsy (stage I sleep) EEG for patient's age."
307,Neurology,REPORT: The electroencephalogram shows background activity at about 9-10 cycle/second bilaterally. Little activity in the beta range is noted. Waves of 4-7 cycle/second of low amplitude were occasionally noted. Abundant movements and technical artifacts are noted throughout this tracing. Hyperventilation was not performed. Photic stimulation reveals no important changes.CLINICAL INTERPRETATION: The electroencephalogram is essentially normal.
308,Neurology,"REPORT: This is an 18-channel recording obtained using the standard scalp and referential electrodes observing the 10/20 international system. The patient was reported to be cooperative and was awake throughout the recording.CLINICAL NOTE: This is a 51-year-old male, who is being evaluated for dizziness. Spontaneous activity is fairly well organized, characterized by low-to-medium voltage waves of about 8 to 9 Hz seen mainly from the posterior head region. Intermixed with it is a moderate amount of low voltage fast activity seen from the anterior head region.Eye opening caused a bilateral symmetrical block on the first run. In addition to the above description, movement of muscle and other artifacts are seen.On subsequent run, no additional findings were seen.During subsequent run, again no additional findings were seen.Hyperventilation was omitted.Photic stimulation was performed, but no clear-cut photic driving was seen.EKG was monitored during this recording and it showed normal sinus rhythm when monitored.IMPRESSION: This record is essentially within normal limits. Clinical correlation is recommended."
309,Neurology,"A 21-channel digital electroencephalogram is performed on the patient, predominantly in a drowsy and sleepy state. In brief periods of wakefulness, significant muscle artifact is noted bilaterally. With drowsiness, the recording slows, and with the sleep, vertex activity is noted. Recording is somewhat disorganized for age with intermixed theta and alpha activity. At times, higher voltage slowing is noted over the right compared to the left hemisphere head regions. Rare sharp wave activity is noted generally on the right over the C4 electrode, but rarely on the left over the T3 electrode. No spike-and-wave activity is noted.IMPRESSION: Abnormal electroencephalogram revealing generalized poorly organized slowing, with more prominent slowing noted at the right compared to the left hemisphere head regions and rare sharp wave activity noted bilaterally, somewhat more prevalent on the right. Clinical correlation is suggested."
310,Neurology,"PROCEDURE: A 21-channel digital electroencephalogram was performed on a patient in the awake state. Per the technician's notes, the patient is taking Depakene.The recording consists of symmetric 9 Hz alpha activity. Throughout the recording, repetitive episodes of bursts of 3 per second spike and wave activity are noted. The episodes last from approximately1 to 7 seconds. The episodes are exacerbated by hyperventilation.IMPRESSION: Abnormal electroencephalogram with repetitive bursts of 3 per second spike and wave activity exacerbated by hyperventilation. This activity could represent true petit mal epilepsy. Clinical correlation is suggested."
311,Neurology,"HISTORY: This is a digital EEG performed on a 75-year-old male with seizures.BACKGROUND ACTIVITY: The background activity consists of a 8 Hz to 9 Hz rhythm arising in the posterior head region. This rhythm is also accompanied by some beta activity which occurs infrequently. There are also muscle contractions occurring at 4 Hz to 5 Hz which suggests possible Parkinson's. Part of the EEG is obscured by the muscle contraction artifact. There are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing. At one point of time, there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region.ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Photic stimulation was performed and did not show any significant abnormality.SLEEP PATTERNS: No sleep architecture was observed during this tracing.IMPRESSION: This awake/alert/drowsy EEG is abnormal due to the presence of slowing in the right frontal head region, due to the presence of sharps arising in the left temporal head region, and due to the tremors. The slowing can be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities, so a stroke, subdural hematoma, etc., should be ruled out. The tremor probably represents a Parkinson's tremor and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities, so clinical correlation is recommended."
312,Neurology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history of diet-controlled diabetes, diffuse arthritis, plantar fasciitis, and muscle cramps who presents with a few-month history of numbness in both big toes and up the lateral aspect of both calves. Symptoms worsened considerable about a month ago. This normally occurs after being on her feet for any length of time. She was started on amitriptyline and this has significantly improved her symptoms. She is almost asymptomatic at present. She dose complain of longstanding low back pain, but no pain that radiates from her back into her legs. She has had no associated weakness.On brief examination, straight leg raising is normal. The patient is obese. There is mild decreased vibration and light touch in distal lower extremities. Strength is full and symmetric. Deep tendon reflexes at the knees are 2+ and symmetric and absent at the ankles.NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Bilateral sural sensory responses are absent. Bilateral superficial sensory responses are present, but mildly reduced. The right radial sensory response is normal. The right common peroneal and tibial motor responses are normal. Bilateral H-reflexes are absent.NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the right leg and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and the left tibialis posterior using a concentric disposable needle. It revealed increased insertional activity in the right tibialis posterior muscle with signs of mild chronic denervation in bilateral peroneus longus muscles and the right tibialis posterior muscle. Lumbar paraspinals were attempted, but were too painful to get a good assessment.IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following:1. A very mild, purely sensory length-dependent peripheral neuropathy.2. Mild bilateral L5 nerve root irritation. There is no evidence of active radiculopathy.Based on the patient's history and exam, her new symptoms are consistent with mild bilateral L5 radiculopathies. Symptoms have almost completely resolved over the last month since starting Elavil. I would recommend MRI of the lumbosacral spine if symptoms return. With respect to the mild neuropathy, this is probably related to her mild glucose intolerance/early diabetes. However, I would recommend a workup for other causes to include the following: Fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, ESR, RPR, TSH, B12, serum protein electrophoresis and Lyme titer."
313,Neurology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 52-year-old right-handed female with longstanding bilateral arm pain, which is predominantly in the medial aspect of her arms and hands as well as left hand numbness, worse at night and after doing repetitive work with her left hand. She denies any weakness. No significant neck pain, change in bowel or bladder symptoms, change in gait, or similar symptoms in the past. She is on Lyrica for the pain, which has been somewhat successful.Examination reveals positive Phalen's test on the left. Remainder of her neurological examination is normal.NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: The left median motor distal latency is prolonged with normal evoked response amplitude and conduction velocity. The left median sensory distal latency is prolonged with an attenuated evoked response amplitude. The right median sensory distal latency is mildly prolonged with a mildly attenuated evoked response amplitude. The right median motor distal latency and evoked response amplitude is normal. Left ulnar motor and sensory and left radial sensory responses are normal. Left median F-wave is normal.NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the left arm, right first dorsal interosseous muscle, and bilateral cervical paraspinal muscles. It revealed spontaneous activity in the left abductor pollicis brevis muscle. There is increased insertional activity in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. Both interosseous muscles showed signs of reinnervation. Left extensor digitorum communis muscle showed evidence of reduced recruitment. Cervical paraspinal muscles were normal.IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following: A left median neuropathy at the wrist consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome. Electrical abnormalities are moderate-to-mild bilateral C8 radiculopathies. This may be an incidental finding.I have recommended MRI of the spine without contrast and report will be sent to Dr. XYZ. She will follow up with Dr. XYZ with respect to treatment of the above conditions."
314,Neurology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 78-year-old right-handed inpatient with longstanding history of cervical spinal stenosis status post decompression, opioid dependence, who has had longstanding low back pain radiating into the right leg. She was undergoing a spinal epidural injection about a month ago and had worsening of right low back pain, which radiates down into her buttocks and down to posterior aspect of her thigh into her knee. This has required large amounts of opioid analgesics to control. She has been basically bedridden because of this. She was brought into hospital for further investigations.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, she has positive straight leg rising on the right with severe shooting, radicular type pain with right leg movement. Difficult to assess individual muscles, but strength is largely intact. Sensory examination is symmetric. Deep tendon reflexes reveal hyporeflexia in both patellae, which probably represents a cervical myelopathy from prior cord compression. She has slightly decreased right versus left ankle reflexes. The Babinski's are positive. On nerve conduction studies, motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in lower extremities.NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the right leg and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle. It reveals the spontaneous activity in right peroneus longus and gastrocnemius medialis muscles as well as the right lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles. There is evidence of denervation in right gastrocnemius medialis muscle.IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following:1. Inactive right S1 (L5) radiculopathy.2. There is no evidence of left lower extremity radiculopathy, peripheral neuropathy or entrapment neuropathy.Results were discussed with the patient and she is scheduled for imaging studies in the next day."
315,Neurology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 56-year-old right-handed female with longstanding intermittent right low back pain, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in September of 2005. At that time, she did not notice any specific injury. Five days later, she started getting abnormal right low back pain. At this time, it radiates into the buttocks down the posterior aspect of her thigh and into the right lateral aspect of her calf. Symptoms are worse when sitting for any length of time, such as driving a motor vehicle. Mild symptoms when walking for long periods of time. Relieved by standing and lying down. She denies any left leg symptoms or right leg weakness. No change in bowel or bladder function. Symptoms have slowly progressed. She has had Medrol Dosepak and analgesics, which have not been very effective. She underwent a spinal epidural injection, which was effective for the first few hours, but she had recurrence of the pain by the next day. This was done four and a half weeks ago.On examination, lower extremities strength is full and symmetric. Straight leg raising is normal.OBJECTIVE: Sensory examination is normal to all modalities. Full range of movement of lumbosacral spine. Mild tenderness over lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and sacroiliac joint. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the knees, 2 at the left ankle and 1+ at the right ankle.NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response, amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the lower extremities. Right tibial H-reflex is slightly prolonged when compared to the left tibial H-reflex.NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed in both lower extremities and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using the disposable concentric needle. It revealed increased insertional activity in the right mid and lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles as well as right peroneus longus muscle. There were signs of chronic denervation in right tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, and left gastrocnemius medialis muscles.IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following:1. A mild right L5 versus S1 radiculopathy.2. Left S1 nerve root irritation. There is no evidence of active radiculopathy.3. There is no evidence of plexopathy, myopathy or peripheral neuropathy.MRI of the lumbosacral spine was personally reviewed and reveals bilateral L5-S1 neuroforaminal stenosis, slightly worse on the right. Results were discussed with the patient and her daughter. I would recommend further course of spinal epidural injections with Dr. XYZ. If she has no response, then surgery will need to be considered. She agrees with this approach and will followup with you in the near future."
316,Neurology,"NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Bilateral ulnar sensory responses are absent. Bilateral median sensory distal latencies are prolonged with a severely attenuated evoked response amplitude. The left radial sensory response is normal and robust. Left sural response is absent. Left median motor distal latency is prolonged with attenuated evoked response amplitude. Conduction velocity across the forearm is mildly slowed. Right median motor distal latency is prolonged with a normal evoked response amplitude and conduction velocity. The left ulnar motor distal latency is prolonged with a severely attenuated evoked response amplitude both below and above the elbow. Conduction velocities across the forearm and across the elbow are prolonged. Conduction velocity proximal to the elbow is normal. The right median motor distal latency is normal with normal evoked response amplitudes at the wrist with a normal evoked response amplitude at the wrist. There is mild diminution of response around the elbow. Conduction velocity slows across the elbow. The left common peroneal motor distal latency evoked response amplitude is normal with slowed conduction velocity across the calf and across the fibula head. F-waves are prolonged.NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the left arm and lumbosacral and cervical paraspinal muscles as well as middle thoracic muscles using a disposable concentric needle. It revealed spontaneous activity in lower cervical paraspinals, left abductor pollicis brevis, and first dorsal interosseous muscles. There were signs of chronic reinnervation in triceps, extensor digitorum communis, flexor pollicis longus as well first dorsal interosseous and abductor pollicis brevis muscles.IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following:1. A sensory motor length-dependent neuropathy consistent with diabetes.2. A severe left ulnar neuropathy. This is probably at the elbow, although definitive localization cannot be made.3. Moderate-to-severe left median neuropathy. This is also probably at the carpal tunnel, although definitive localization cannot be made.4. Right ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, mild.5. Right median neuropathy at the wrist consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome, moderate.6. A left C8 radiculopathy (double crush syndrome).7. There is no evidence for thoracic radiculitis.The patient has made very good response with respect to his abdominal pain since starting Neurontin. He still has mild allodynia and is waiting for authorization to get insurance coverage for his Lidoderm patch. He is still scheduled for MRI of C-spine and T-spine. I will see him in followup after the above scans."
317,Neurology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 51-year-old status post C3-C4 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion in 1986 and again in 1994. She had excellent response to those surgeries. She was pain free until about a year ago when she started noticing pain in her neck, both shoulders, and down her right arm. Around the same time she also noticed low back pain radiating down the posterior aspect of the right leg into her right foot. She noticed weakness in the right hand especially with opening bottles, etc. The weakness has improved somewhat. She feels that her pain is worsening. She denies any left arm or leg symptoms. No change in bladder function. Over the last year she states that she has undergone physical therapy as well as steroid injections in her neck, but these were not effective. She states her right upper extremity symptoms are more severe than the lower extremity symptoms.She has an extensive past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and irritable bowel syndrome. She has also had bilateral carpal tunnel release.On examination, normal range of movement of C-spine. She has full strength in upper and lower extremities. Normal straight leg raising. Reflexes are 2 and symmetric throughout. No Babinski. She has numbness to light touch in her right big toe.NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: The right median palmar sensory distal latencies are minimally prolonged with minimally attenuated evoked response amplitude. Bilateral tibial motor nerves could not be obtained (technical). The remaining nerves tested revealed normal distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, F-waves, and H. reflexes.NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the right arm and leg and lumbosacral and cervical paraspinal muscles and the left FDI. It revealed 2+ spontaneous activity in the right APB and FDI and 1+ spontaneous activity in lower cervical paraspinals, lower and middle lumbosacral paraspinals, right extensor digitorum communis muscle, and right pronator teres. There was evidence of chronic denervation in the right first dorsal interosseous, pronator teres, abductor pollicis brevis, and left first dorsal interosseous.IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following:1. An active right C8/T1 radiculopathy. Electrical abnormalities are moderate.2. An active right C6/C7 radiculopathy. Electrical abnormalities are mild.3. Evidence of chronic left C8/T1 denervation. No active denervation.4. Mild right lumbosacral radiculopathies. This could not be further localized because of normal EMG testing in the lower extremity muscles.5. There is evidence of mild sensory carpal tunnel on the right (she has had previous carpal tunnel release).Results were discussed with the patient. It appears that she has failed conservative therapy and I have recommended to her that she return to Dr. X for his assessment for possible surgery to her C-spine. She will continue with conservative therapy for the mild lumbosacral radiculopathies."
318,Neurology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 46-year-old right-handed gentleman with a past medical history of a left L5-S1 lumbar microdiskectomy in 1998 with complete resolution of left leg symptoms, who now presents with a four-month history of gradual onset of right-sided low back pain with pain radiating down into his buttock and posterior aspect of his right leg into the ankle. Symptoms are worsened by any activity and relieved by rest. He also feels that when the pain is very severe, he has some subtle right leg weakness. No left leg symptoms. No bowel or bladder changes.On brief examination, full strength in both lower extremities. No sensory abnormalities. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the patellas and absent at both ankles. Positive straight leg raising on the right.MRI of the lumbosacral spine was personally reviewed and reveals a right paracentral disc at L5-S1 encroaching upon the right exiting S1 nerve root.NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, and conduction velocities are normal in the lower extremities. The right common peroneal F-wave is minimally prolonged. The right tibial H reflex is absent.NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the right leg, left gastrocnemius medialis muscle, and right lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle. It revealed spontaneous activity in the right gastrocnemius medialis, gluteus maximus, and lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles. There was evidence of chronic denervation in right gastrocnemius medialis and gluteus maximus muscles.IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals an acute right S1 radiculopathy. There is no evidence for peripheral neuropathy or left or right L5 radiculopathy.Results were discussed with the patient and he is scheduled to follow up with Dr. X in the near future."
319,Neurology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 34-year-old right-handed female who states her symptoms first started after a motor vehicle accident in September 2005. She may have had a brief loss of consciousness at the time of the accident since shortly thereafter she had some blurred vision, which lasted about a week and then resolved. Since that time she has had right low neck pain and left low back pain. She has been extensively worked up and treated for this. MRI of the C & T spine and LS spine has been normal. She has improved significantly, but still complains of pain. In June of this year she had different symptoms, which she feels are unrelated. She had some chest pain and feeling of tightness in the left arm and leg and face. By the next morning she had numbness around her lips on the left side and encompassing the whole left arm and leg. Symptoms lasted for about two days and then resolved. However, since that time she has had intermittent numbness in the left hand and leg. The face numbness has completely resolved. Symptoms are mild. She denies any previous similar episodes. She denies associated dizziness, vision changes incoordination, weakness, change in gait, or change in bowel or bladder function. There is no associated headache.Brief examination reveals normal motor examination with no pronator drift and no incoordination. Normal gait. Cranial nerves are intact. Sensory examination reveals normal facial sensation. She has normal and symmetrical light touch, temperature, and pinprick in the upper extremities. In the lower extremities she has a feeling of dysesthesia in the lateral aspect of the left calf into the lateral aspect of the left foot. In this area she has normal light touch and pinprick. She describes it as a strange unusual sensation.NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the left arm and leg.NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed in the left leg, lumbosacral paraspinal, right tibialis anterior, and right upper thoracic paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle. It revealed normal insertional activity, no spontaneous activity, and normal motor unit action potential form in all muscles tested.IMPRESSION: This electrical study is normal. There is no evidence for peripheral neuropathy, entrapment neuropathy, plexopathy, or lumbosacral radiculopathy. EMG was also performed in the right upper thoracic paraspinal where she has experienced a lot of pain since the motor vehicle accident. This was normal.Based on her history of sudden onset of left face, arm, and leg weakness as well as a normal EMG and MRI of her spine I am concerned that she had a central event in June of this year. Symptoms are now very mild, but I have ordered an MRI of the brain with and without contrast and MRA of the head and neck with contrast to further elucidate her symptoms. Once she has the test done she will phone me and further management will be based on the results."
320,Neurology,"REFERRING DIAGNOSIS: Motor neuron disease.PERTINENT HISTORY AND EXAMINATION: Briefly, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of progression of dysphagia for the past year, dysarthria, weakness of her right arm, cramps in her legs, and now with progressive weakness in her upper extremities.SUMMARY: The right median sensory response showed a borderline normal amplitude for age with mild slowing of conduction velocity. The right ulnar sensory amplitude was reduced with slowing of the conduction velocity. The right radial sensory amplitude was reduced with slowing of the conduction velocity. The right sural and left sural sensory responses were absent. The right median motor response showed a prolonged distal latency across the wrist, with proximal slowing. The distal amplitude was very reduced, and there was a reduction with proximal stimulation. The right ulnar motor amplitude was borderline normal, with slowing of the conduction velocity across the elbow. The right common peroneal motor response showed a decreased amplitude when recorded from the EDB, with mild slowing of the proximal conduction velocity across the knee. The right tibial motor response showed a reduced amplitude with prolongation of the distal latency. The left common peroneal response recorded from the EDB showed a decreased amplitude with mild distal slowing. The left tibial motor response showed a decreased amplitude with a borderline normal distal latency. The minimum F-wave latencies were normal with the exception of a mild prolongation of the ulnar F-wave latency, and the tibial F-wave latency as indicated above. With repetitive nerve stimulation, there was no significant decrement noted in either the right nasalis or the right trapezius muscles. Concentric needle EMG studies were performed in the right lower extremity, right upper extremity, thoracic paraspinals, and in the tongue. There was evidence of increased insertional activity in the right tibialis anterior muscle, with evidence of fasciculations noted in several lower and upper extremity muscles and in the tongue. In addition, there was evidence of increased amplitude, long duration and polyphasic motor units with a decreased recruitment noted in most muscles tested as indicated in the table above.INTERPRETATION: Abnormal electrodiagnostic study. There is electrodiagnostic evidence of a disorder of the anterior motor neurons affecting at least four segments. There is also evidence of a more generalized neuropathy that seems to be present in both the upper and lower extremities. There is also evidence of a right median mononeuropathy at the wrist and a right ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. Even despite the patient's age, the decrease in sensory responses is concerning, and makes it difficult to be certain about the diagnosis of motor neuron disease. However, the overall changes on the needle EMG would be consistent with a diagnosis of motor neuron disease. The patient will return for further evaluation."

There is borderline evidence of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. The sensory and motor responses are noted to be attenuated in both upper extremities.The needle EMG examination is remarkable for rather diffuse active denervation changes in most muscles of the right upper and right lower extremity tested and there is active denervation in several muscles of the left arm and left leg as well. The diffuse nature of the active denervation changes in multiple myotomes of both upper and lower extremities suggests the possibility of motor neuron disease. Other neuropathic conditions, polymyositis, etc., need to be considered in differential diagnosis."

Acute quadriplegia.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:1. Evacuation of epidural hematoma.2. Insertion of epidural drain.ANESTHESIA: General.COMPLICATIONS: None.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 200 cc.HISTORY: This is a 64-year-old female who has had an extensive medical history beginning with coronary artery bypass done on emergent basis while she was in Maryland in April of 2003 after having myocardial infarction. She was then transferred to Beaumont Hospital, at which point, she developed a sternal abscess. The patient was treated for the abscess in Beaumont and then subsequently transferred to some other type of facility near her home in Warren, Michigan at which point, she developed a second what was termed minor myocardial infarction.The patient subsequently recovered in a Cardiac Rehab Facility and approximately two weeks later, brings us to the month of August, at which time she was at home ambulating with a walker or a cane, and then sustained a fall and at that point she was unable to walk and had acute progressive weakness and was identified as having a central cord syndrome based on an MRI, which showed record signal change. The patient underwent cervical laminectomy and seemed to be improving subjectively in terms of neurologic recovery, but objectively there was not much improvement. Approximately 10 days after the surgery, brings us to today's date, the health officer was notified of the patient's labored breathing. When she examined the patient, she also noted that the patient was unable to move her extremities. She was concerned and called the Orthopedic resident who identified the patient to be truly quadriplegic. I was notified and ordered the operative crew to report immediately and recommended emergent decompression for the possibility of an epidural hematoma. On clinical examination, there was swelling in the posterior aspect of the neck. The patient has no active movement in the upper and lower extremity muscle groups. Reflexes are absent in the upper and lower extremities. Long track signs are absent. Sensory level is at the C4 dermatome. Rectal tone is absent. I discussed the findings with the patient and also the daughter. We discussed the possibility of this is permanent quadriplegia, but at this time, the compression of the epidural space was warranted and certainly for exploration reasons be sure that there is a hematoma there and they have agreed to proceed with surgery. They are aware that it is possible she had known permanent neurologic status regardless of my intervention and they have agreed to accept this and has signed the consent form for surgery.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to OR #1 at ABCD General Hospital on a gurney. Department of Anesthesia administered fiberoptic intubation and general anesthetic. A Foley catheter was placed in the bladder. The patient was log rolled in a prone position on the Jackson table. Bony prominences were well padded. The patient's head was placed in the prone view anesthesia head holder. At this point, the wound was examined closely and there was hematoma at the caudal pole of the wound. Next, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The previous skin incision was reopened. At this point, hematoma properly exits from the wound. All sutures were removed and the epidural spaces were encountered at this time. The self-retaining retractors were placed in the depth of the wound. Consolidated hematoma was now removed from the wound. Next, the epidural space was encountered. There was no additional hematoma in the epidural space or on the thecal sac. A curette was carefully used to scrape along the thecal sac and there was no film or lining covering the sac. The inferior edge of the C2 lamina was explored and there was no compression at this level and the superior lamina of T1 was explored and again no compression was identified at this area as well. Next, the wound was irrigated copiously with one liter of saline using a syringe. The walls of the wound were explored. There was no active bleeding. Retractors were removed at this time and even without pressure on the musculature, there was no active bleeding. A #19 French Hemovac drain was passed percutaneously at this point and placed into the epidural space. Fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with #3-0 Vicryl sutures. Steri-Strips covered the incision and dressing was then applied over the incision. The patient was then log rolled in the supine position on the hospital gurney. She remained intubated for airway precautions and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. Once in the recovery room, she was alert. She was following simple commands and using her head to nod, but she did not have any active movement of her upper or lower extremities. Prognosis for this patient is guarded."
326,Neurology,"REASON FOR CONSULT: Essential tremor and torticollis.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 62-year-old right-handed now left-handed white female with tremor since 5th grade. She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam. She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better. She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity. Since around 6 to 7 years, she has had a head tremor, which is mainly ""no- no"" and occasional voice tremor also. Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura, which are far and few apart. She also has some stress incontinence. Last MRI brain was done in 2001 reportedly normal.CURRENT MEDICATIONS:1. Klonopin 0.5 mg twice a day.2. Primidone 100 mg b.i.d.3. Propranolol long-acting 80 mg once in the morning.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Essential tremor, cervical dystonia, endometriosis, migraine headaches without aura, left ear sensorineural deafness, and basal cell carcinoma resection on the nose.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: L5-S1 lumbar laminectomy in 1975, exploratory laparotomy in 1967, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, and anal fissure surgery in 1975.FAMILY HISTORY: Both parents have ET and hypertension. Maternal cousin with lupus.SOCIAL HISTORY: Denies any smoking or alcohol. She is married since 44 years, has 3 children. She used to work as a labor and delivery nurse up until early 2001 when she retired.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No fever, chills, nausea or vomiting. No visual complaints. She complains of hearing decreased on the left. No chest pain or shortness of breath. No constipation. She does give a history of urge incontinence. No rashes. No depressive symptoms.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure is 131/72, pulse is 50, and weight is 71.3 kg. HEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. CARDIOVASCULAR: S1 and S2 normal. Regular rate and rhythm. She does have a rash over the right ankle with a prior basal cell carcinoma was resected. NEUROLOGIC: Alert and oriented x4. Speech shows a voice tremor occasionally. Language is intact. Cranial nerves II through XII intact. Motor examination showed 5/5 power in all extremities with minimal increased tone. Sensory examination was intact to light touch. Reflexes were brisk bilaterally, but they were equal and both toes were downgoing. Her coordination showed minimal intentional component to bilateral finger-to-nose. Gait was intact. Lot of swing on Romberg's. The patient did have a tremor both upper extremities, right more than left. She did have a head tremor, which was no-no variety, and she had a minimal torticollis with her head twisted to the left.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This 62-year-old white female has essential tremor and mild torticollis. Tremor not bothersome for most activities of daily living, but she does have a great difficulty writing, which is totally illegible. The patient did not wish to change any of her medication doses at this point. We will go ahead and check MRI brain, and we will get the films later. We will see her back in 3 months. Also, the patient declined any possible Botox for the mild torticollis she has at this point."

328,Neurology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of feet and hand cramps. He states that for the past six months he has experienced cramps in his feet and hands. He describes that the foot cramps are much more notable than the hand ones. He reports that he develops muscle contractions of his toes on both feet. These occur exclusively at night. They may occur about three times per week. When he develops these cramps, he stands up to relieve the discomfort. He notices that the toes are in an extended position. He steps on the ground and they seem to ""pop into place."" He develops calf pain after he experiences the cramp. Sometimes they awaken him from his sleep.He also has developed cramps in his hands although they are less severe and less frequent than those in his legs. These do not occur at night and are completely random. He notices that his thumb assumes a flexed position and sometimes he needs to pry it open to relieve the cramp.He has never had any symptoms like this in the past. He started taking Bactrim about nine months ago. He had taken this in the past briefly, but has never taken it as long as he has now. He cannot think of any other possible contributing factors to his symptoms.He has a history of HIV for 21 years. He was taking antiretroviral medications, but stopped about six or seven years ago. He reports that he was unable to tolerate the medications due to severe stomach upset. He has a CD4 count of 326. He states that he has never developed AIDS. He is considering resuming antiretroviral treatment.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has diabetes, but this is well controlled. He also has hepatitis C and HIV.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: He takes insulin and Bactrim.ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives alone. He recently lost his partner. This happened about six months ago. He denies alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use. He is now retired. He is very active and walks about four miles every few days.FAMILY HISTORY: His father and mother had diabetes.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above. This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Vital Signs: Blood pressure 130/70 HR 80 RR 18 Wt 153 poundsGeneral Appearance: Patient is well appearing, in no acute distress.Cardiovascular: There is a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. There are no carotid bruits.Chest: The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.Skin: There are no rashes or lesions.Musculoskeletal: There are no joint deformities or scoliosis.NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:Mental Status: Speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia. The patient is alert and oriented to name, place, and date. Attention, concentration, registration, recall, and fund of knowledge are all intact.Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Optic discs are normal. Visual fields are full. Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus. Facial sensation is normal. There is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness. Hearing is grossly intact. Shoulder shrug is full.Motor: There is normal muscle bulk and tone. There is no atrophy or fasciculations. There is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia. Manual muscle testing reveals MRC grade 5/5 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities.Sensory: Sensation is intact to light touch, pinprick, temperature, vibratory sensation, and joint position sense. Romberg is absent.Coordination: There is no dysmetria or ataxia on finger-nose-finger or heel-to-shin testing.Reflexes: Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ at the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellas and ankles. Plantar reflexes are flexor. There are no finger flexors, Hoffman's sign, or jaw jerk.Gait and Stance: Casual gait is normal. Heel, toe, and tandem walking are all normal.LABORATORY DATA: August 06, 2008: Glucose 122. BUN 23. CR 1.16. Ca 7.8. K 4.6. Na 135. ALT 85. AST 192. HIV positive. Hemoglobin A1c 5.5. CD4 326. HPV positive. HCT 37.9. PLT 129. ESR 34.ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with a longstanding history of HIV, who developed a recent history of nocturnal cramps in his feet and less frequent cramps in his hands. His neurological examination today is normal. I think it is possible that the cramps are related to the Bactrim. This is a very rare side effect, but it has been reported in the literature that patients can develop cramps due to this medication. He does not have any obvious metabolic abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypokalemia that can cause muscle cramps. He also does not have any evidence of an underlying neuromuscular disorder as I would expect him to have weakness or other abnormalities if this were the case. Certain metabolic myopathies can be associated with normal neurological examination and muscle cramps. This can be seen in the HIV patients who are taking antiretrovirals, but he has not been taking any of these medications for a long time.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. I think that he should try to stop taking the Bactrim and see if his symptoms improve. I told him that I would defer to his primary care physician for this option. Specifically, if there is another medication that he could take instead of Bactrim, this would be most desirable. He will discuss this with his primary care physician. If he cannot stop the medication, then I am not sure we would figure out if this is a true cause.2. I gave him a prescription for Neurontin. I discussed the side effects of the medication with the patient. I instructed him to slowly taper the dose over several days to 300 mg t.i.d. I am hopeful this will provide some symptomatic relief. If this does not, I would consider starting on baclofen.3. If he stops taking the medication and his pain improves, then I would consider pulling back on the Neurontin and seeing if he is completely asymptomatic. However, if he continues to be symptomatic despite stopping Bactrim, then I would consider performing further diagnostic testing such as an EMG and nerve conduction studies and ordering additional serologic testing such as a CPK."
329,Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: Mr. A is an 86-year-old man who returns for his first followup after shunt surgery.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: I have followed Mr. A since May 2008. He presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June of 2008 and Mr. A underwent shunt surgery performed by Dr. X on August 1st. A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.Mr. A comes today with his daughter, Pam and together they give his history.Mr. A has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him. With respect to his walking, his daughter tells me that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine, but could not before his surgery. His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment. With respect to his bladder, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper.With respect to his cognition, both Pam and the patient say that his thinking has improved. The other daughter, Patty summarized it best according to two of them. She said, ""I feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again."" Mr. A has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or at the abdomen.MEDICATIONS: Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 25 mg p.o. q.d., Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q.d., Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d., Detrol LA 4 mg p.o. q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., Imodium daily, Omega-3, fish oil, and Lasix.MAJOR FINDINGS: Mr. A is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.Vital Signs: Blood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.The shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.Mental Status: Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge. He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations. Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice. This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.Gait: Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool. He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28. This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal. Extraocular movements are intact. Face symmetric. No dysarthria.Motor: Normal for bulk and strength.Coordination: Slow for finger-to-nose.IMAGING: CT scan was reviewed from 10/15/2008. It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm. By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection. This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extraaxial fluid collections. There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.ASSESSMENT: Mr. A has made some improvement since shunt surgery.PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:1. Adult hydrocephalus (331.5).2. Gait impairment (781.2).3. Urinary incontinence and urgency (788.33).4. Cognitive impairment (290.0).PLAN: I had a long discussion with Mr. A and his daughter. We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because I believe I see a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt. I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptotic and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.Mr. A asked me about whether he will be able to drive again. Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test. I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe Mr. A is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time. I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test."
330,Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right occipital arteriovenous malformation.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right occipital arteriovenous malformation.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: CT-guided frameless stereotactic radiosurgery for the right occipital arteriovenous malformation using dynamic tracking.Please note no qualified resident was available to assist in the procedure.INDICATION: The patient is a 30-year-old male with a right occipital AVM. He was referred for stereotactic radiosurgery. The risks of the radiosurgical treatment were discussed with the patient including, but not limited to, failure to completely obliterate the AVM, need for additional therapy, radiation injury, radiation necrosis, headaches, seizures, visual loss, or other neurologic deficits. The patient understands these risks and would like to proceed.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient arrived to Outpatient CyberKnife Suite one day prior to the treatment. He was placed on the treatment table. The Aquaplast mask was constructed. Initial imaging was obtained by the CyberKnife system. The patient was then transported over to the CT scanner at Stanford. Under the supervision of Dr. X, 125 mL of Omnipaque 250 contrast was administered. Dr. X then supervised the acquisition of 1.2-mm contiguous axial CT slices. These images were uploaded over the hospital network to the treatment planning computer, and the patient was discharged home.Treatment plan was then performed by me. I outlined the tumor volume. Inverse treatment planning was used to generate the treatment plan for this patient. This resulted in a total dose of 20 Gy delivered to 84% isodose line using a 12.5 mm collimator. The maximum dose within this center of treatment volume was 23.81 Gy. The volume treated was 2.972 mL, and the treated lesion dimensions were 1.9 x 2.7 x 1.6 cm. The volume treated at the reference dose was 98%. The coverage isodose line was 79%. The conformality index was 1.74 and modified conformality index was 1.55. The treatment plan was reviewed by me and Dr. Y of Radiation Oncology, and the treatment plan was approved.On the morning of May 14, 2004, the patient arrived at the Outpatient CyberKnife Suite. He was placed on the treatment table. The Aquaplast mask was applied. Initial imaging was used to bring the patient into optimal position. The patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to deliver the 20 Gy to the AVM margin. He tolerated the procedure well. He was given 8 mg of Decadron for prophylaxis and discharged home.Followup will consist of an MRI scan in 6 months. The patient will return to our clinic once that study is completed.I was present and participated in the entire procedure on this patient consisting of CT-guided frameless stereotactic radiosurgery for the right occipital AVM.Dr. X was present during the entire procedure and will be dictating his own operative note."
331,Neurology,"CC: DysarthriaHX: This 52y/o RHF was transferred from a local hospital to UIHC on 10/28/94 with a history of progressive worsening of vision, dysarthria, headache, and incoordination beginning since 2/94. Her husband recalled her first difficulties became noticeable after a motor vehicle accident in 2/94. She was a belted passenger in a car struck at a stop. There was no reported head or neck injury or alteration of consciousness. She was treated and released from a local ER the same day. Her husband noted the development of mild dysarthria, incoordination, headache and exacerbation of preexisting lower back pain within 2 week of the accident. In 4/94 she developed stress urinary incontinence which spontaneously resolved in June. In 8/94, her HA changed from a dull constant aching in the bitemporal region to a sharper constant pain in the nuchal/occipital area. She also began experiencing increased blurred vision, worsening dysarthria and difficulty hand writing. In 9/94 she was evaluated by a local physician. Examination then revealed incoordination, generalized fatigue, and dysarthria. Soon after this she became poorly arousable and increasingly somnolent. She had difficulty walking and generalized weakness. On 10/14/94, she lost the ability to walk by herself. Evaluation at a local hospital revealed: 1)Normal electronystagmography, 2)two lumbar punctures which revealed some atypical mononuclear cells suggestive of ""tumor or reactive lymphocytosis."" One of these CSF analysis showed: Glucose 16, Protein 99, WBC 14, RBC 114. Echocardiogram was normal. Bone marrow biopsy was normal except for decreased iron. Abdominal-Pelvic CT scan, CXR, Mammogram, PPD, ANA, TFT, and RPR were unremarkable. A 10/31/94 MRI brain scan a 5x10mm area of increased signal on T2 weighted images in the right remporal lobe lateral to the anterior aspect of the temporal horn, right posterolateral aspect of the midbrain, pons, and bilateral inferior surface of the cerebellum involving gray and white matter. These areas did not enhance with gadolinium contrast on T1 weighted images.MEDS: none.PMH: 1)G3P3, 2)last menses one year ago.FHX: Mother suffered stroke in her 70's. DM and Htn in family.SHX: Married, Secretary, No h/o tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use.ROS: no weight loss, fever, chills, nightsweats, cough, dysphagia.EXAM: BP139/74, HR 90, RR20, 36.8CMS: Drowsy to somnolent, occasionally ""giddy."" Oriented to person, place, time. Minimal dysarthric speech, but appropriate. MMSE 27/30 (copy of exam not in chart).CN: Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Optic disks were flat and without sign of papilledema. VFFTC. EOM intact. No nystagmus. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable.Motor: 5/5 strength throughout. Normal muscle tone and bulk.Sensory: No deficit to LT/PP/VIB/PROP.Coord: difficulty with RAM in BUE, and ataxia on FNF and HKS in all extremities.Station: Romberg sign present.Gait: unsteady, wide-based, with notable difficulty on TW, TT and HW.Reflexes: 2/2 BUE, 0/1 patellae, trace at both archilles, Plantars responses were flexor, bilaterally.Gen Exam: unremarkable.COURSE: CSF analysis by lumbar puncture, 10/31/94: Protein 131mg/dl (normal 15-45), Albumin 68 (normal 14-20), IgG10mg/dl (normal <6.2), IgG index -O.1mg/24hr (normal),No oligoclonal bands seen, WBC 33 (19lymphocytes, 1 neutrophil), RBC 29, Glucose 13, Cultures (bacteria, fungal, AFB) were negative, crytococcal Ag negative. The elevated CSF total protein, IgG, and albumin suggested breakdown of the blood brain barrier or blockage of CSF flow. The normal IgG synthesis rate and lack of oligoclonal banding did not suggest demylination. A second CSF analysis on 11/2/94 revealed similar findings; and in addition Anti-purkinje cell and Anti-neuronal antibodies (Yo and Ho) were not found; Beta-2 microglobulin was 1.8 (normal); histoplasmosis Ag negative. Serum ACE, SPEP, Urine histoplasmin were negative.Neuropsychologic assessment, 10/28/94, raised a question of a demential syndrome, but given her response style on the MMPI (marked defensiveness, with unwillingness to admit to even very common human faults) prevented such a diagnosis. Severe defects in memory, fine motor skills, and constructional praxis were noted.Chest-Abdominal-Pelvic CT scans were negative. 11/4/94 cerebral angiogram noted variable caliber in the RMCA, LACA and Left AICA distributions. It was intially thought that thismight be suggestive of a vasculopathy and she was treated with a short course of IV steroids. Temporal artery biopsy was unremarkable.She underwent multiple MRI brain scans at UIHC: 11/4/94, 11/9/94, 11/16/94. All scans consistently showed increase in T2 signal in the brainstem, cerebellar peduncles and temporal lobes bilaterally. These areas did not enhance with gadolinium contrast. These findings were felt most suggestive of glioma.She underwent left temporal lobe brain biopsy on 11/10/94: This study was inconclusive and showed evidence of atypical mononuclear cells and lymphocytes in the perivascular and subarachnoid spaces. Despite cytologic atypia the cells were felt to be reactive in nature, since immunohistochemical stains failed to disclose lymphoid clonality or non-leukocytic phenomena. Little sign of vasculopathy or tumor was found. Bacterial, fungal , HSV, CMV and AFB cultures were negative. HSV, and VZV antigen was negative.Her neurological state progressively worsened throughout her hospital stay. By time of discharge, 12/2/94, she was very somnolent and difficult to arouse and required NGT feeding and 24hour supportive care. She was made DNR after family request prior to transfer to a care facility."
332,Neurology,"CC: HeadacheHX: 37 y/o RHF presented to her local physician with a one month history of intermittent predominantly left occipital headaches which were awakening her in the early morning hours. The headachese were dull to throbbing in character. She was initially treated with Parafon-forte for tension type headaches, but the pain did not resolve. She subsequently underwent HCT in early 12/90 which revealed a right frontal mass lesion.PMH: 1)s/p tonsillectomy. 2)s/p elective abortion.FHX: Mother with breast CA, MA with ""bone cancer."" AODM both sides of family.SHX: Denied tobacco or illicit drug use. Rarely consumes ETOH. Married with 2 teenage children.EXAM: VItal signs unremarkable.MS: Alert and oriented to person, place, time. Lucid thought process per NSG note.CN: unremarkable.Motor: full strength with normal muscle bulk and tone.Sensory: unremarkable.Coordination: unremarkable.Station/Gait: unremarkable.Reflexes: unremarkable.Gen. Exam: unremarkable.COURSE: MRI Brain: large solid and cystic right frontal lobe mass with a large amount of surrounding edema. There is apparent tumor extension into the corpus callosum across the midline. Tumor extension is also suggested in the anterior limb of the interanl capsule on the right. There is midline mass shift to the left with effacement of the anterior horn of the right lateral ventricle. The MRI findings are most consistent with glioblastoma.The patient underwent right frontal lobectomy. The pathological diagnosis was xanthomatous astrocytoma. The literature at the time was not clear as to optimal treatment protocol. People have survived as long as 25 years after diagnosis with this type of tumor. XRT was deferred until 11/91 when an MRI and PET Scan suggested extension of the tumor. She then received 5580 cGy of XRT in divided segments. She developed olfactory auras shortly after lobectomy at was treated with PB with subsequent improvement. She was treated with BCNU chemotherapy protocol in 1992."
333,Neurology,"CC: Headache and diplopia.HX: This 39 y/o African American female began experiencing severe constant pressure pain type headaches beginning the last week of 8/95. The pain localized to bifronto-temporal regions of the head and did not radiate. There was no associated nausea, vomiting, photophobia or phonophobia. The HA's occurred daily; and throughout daylight hours. They diminished at bedtime, but occasionally awakened her in the morning.Several days following the onset of her HA's, she began experiencing numbness and tingling about the right side of her face. These symptoms improved, but did not completely resolved.Several days after the onset of facial paresthesias, she began to experience binocular horizontal diplopia. The diplopia resolved when covering either eye, and worsened upon looking toward the right. Coincidentally, she began veering toward the right when walking. She denied any weakness. She had had chronic unsteadiness for many years since developing juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. She was unsure whether her unsteadiness was due to poor depth perception in light of her diplopia.The patient was admitted locally 9/2/95. HCT, 9/2/95 and Brain MRI with gadolinium, 9/3/95, were ""unremarkable."" Lumbar puncture (done locally),9/3/95: Opening pressure 27cm H20, CSF analysis ( protein 14.0, glucose 66, O WBC, 3 RBC, VDRL non-reactive, Lyme titer unremarkable, Myelin basic protein 1.0 (normal <4.0), and there was no evidence of oligoclonal bands. ESR=76. On 9/11/95 ESR=110.

In addition, she had mild proptosis, OD. The right eye was nontender to palpation during extraocular movement. Visual fields were full to confrontation. Optic disks appeared flat. Face was symmetric with full movement and sensation. Gag, shoulder shrug and corneal responses were intact, bilaterally. Tongue was midline with full ROM.MOTOR: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone.SENSORY: Unremarkable.COORD: Unremarkable FNF/HKS/RAM.STATION: Unremarkable. NO Romberg's sign or drift.GAIT: Narrow based gait. Able to TT and HW without difficulty. Mild difficulty with TW.REFLEXES: 2+/2+ Throughout all 4 extremities. Flexor plantar responses, bilaterally.Musculoskeletal: Swan neck deformities of the #2 and #3 digits of both hands.GEN EXAM: unremarkable, except for obvious sign of right finger reattachment (mentioned above).COURSE: Repeat lumbar puncture yielded: Opening pressure 20.25cm H20, protein 22, glucose 62, 2RBC, 1WBC. CSF cytology, ACE, cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB), gram stain, cryptococcal antigen, and VDRL were negative. Serum ACE, TSH, FT4 were unremarkable.Neuroophthalmology confirmed her right CN6 palsy and proptosis (OD); and noted her complaint of paresthesias in the V1 and V2 distribution. They saw no evidence of papilledema. Visual field testing was unremarkable. MRI Brain/orbit/neck with gadolinium, 10/20/95, revealed abnormal enhancing signal in the right cavernous sinus and sinus mucosal thickening in both maxillary sinuses/ethmoid sinuses/frontal sinuses. CXR, 10/20/95, showed a lobulated mass arising from the right hilum. The mass appeared to obstruct the right middle lobe, causing partial collapse of this lobe. Chest CT with contrast, 10/23/95, revealed a 3.2x4.5x4.0cm mass in the right hilar region with impingement on the right lower bronchus. There appeared to be calcification as well as low attenuation regions within the mass. No lymphadenopathy was noted. She underwent bronchoscopy with bronchial brushing and transbronchial aspirate of the right lung on 10/24/95: no tumor cells were identified, GMS stains were negative and there was no evidence of viral changes, fungus or PCP by culture or molecular assay. She underwent right maxillary sinus biopsy and right middle lobe wedge resection and lymph node biopsy on 11/2/95: Caseating granulomatous inflammation with associated inflammatory pseudotumor was found in both sinus and lung biopsy specimens. No sign of cancer was found. Tissue cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB) were negative times 3. The patients case was discussed at Head and Neck Oncology Tumor Board and a differential diagnosis of Sarcoidosis, Histoplasmosis, Wegener's Granulomatosis, were considered. Urine Histoplasmosis Antigen testing on 11/8/95 was 0.9units (normal<1.0): repeat testing on 12/13/95 was 0.8units. ANCA serum titers on 11/8/95 were <1:40 (normal). PPD testing was negative 11/95 (with positive candida and mumps controls).The etiology of this patient's illness was not discovered. She was last seen 4/96 and her diplopia and right CN6 palsy had moderately improved."
334,Neurology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Followup of hospital discharge for Guillain-Barre syndrome.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 62-year-old right-handed woman with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, a silent stroke involving right basal ganglia who was in her usual state of baseline health until late June of 2006 when she had onset of blurred vision, diplopia, and possible weakness in the right greater than left arm and left-sided ptosis. She was admitted to the hospital. The MRI showed only an old right basal ganglion infarct. She subsequently had a lumbar puncture, which showed increased protein, and an EMG/nerve conduction study performed by Dr. X on July 3rd, showed early signs of AIDP. The patient was treated with intravenous gamma globulin and had some mild improvement in her symptoms. Her vital capacities were normal during the hospitalization. Her chest x-ray was negative for any acute process. She was discharged to rehab from July 12, 2006 to July 20, 2006. She made some progress in which she notes that her walking is definitely better. However, she notes that she still has some problems with eye movement and her vision. This is possibly her main problem. She also reports tightness and pain in her mid back.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Documented in the clinic note. The patient has problems with diabetes, double vision, blurry vision, muscle pain, weakness, trouble walking, and headaches about two to three times per week.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Hypertension.2. Diabetes mellitus.3. Stroke involving the right basal ganglion.4. Guillain-Barre syndrome diagnosed in June of 2006.5. Bilateral knee replacements.6. Total abdominal hysterectomy and cholecystectomy.FAMILY HISTORY: Multiple family members have diabetes mellitus.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is retired on disability due to her knee replacements. She does not smoke, drink or use any illicit drugs.MEDICATIONS: Percocet 5/325 mg 4-6 hours p.r.n., Neurontin 100 mg per day, insulin, Protonix 40 mg per day, Toprol-XL 50 mg q.d., Norvasc 10 mg q.d., glipizide 10 mg q.d., fluticasone 50 mcg nasal spray, Lasix 20 mg b.i.d., and Zocor 1 mg q.d.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 122/74, heart rate 68, respiratory rate 16, and weight 228 pounds. Pain scale 5/10. Please see the written note for details. General exam is benign other than mild obesity. On neuro examination, mental status is normal. Cranial nerves are significant for full visual fields and pupils are equal and reactive. However, extraocular movements are very limited. She has some adduction of the left eye and she has minimal upgaze of both eyes, but otherwise the eyes do not move. Face is symmetric. Sensation is intact. Tongue and uvula are in midline. Palate is elevated symmetrically. Shoulder shrug is strong. The patient's muscle exam shows normal bulk and tone throughout. She has no weakness of the left upper extremity. In the right upper extremity, she has only about 2/5 strength in the right shoulder, but is otherwise 5/5. There is no drift or orbit. Reflexes are absent throughout. Sensory exam is intact to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception is normal. There is no dysmetria. Gait is somewhat limited possibly by her vision and possibly also by her balance problems.PERTINENT DATA: As reviewed previously.DISCUSSION: This is a 62-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke who has what sounds like Guillain-Barre syndrome, likely the Miller-Fisher variant. The patient has shown some improvement with IVIG and continues to show some gradual improvement. I discussed with the patient the course of disease, which is often weeks to about a month or so of worsening followed by many months of gradual improvement.I told her that it is possible she may not recover 100%, but that certainly there is still plenty of time for her to have additional recovery over what she has right now. She is scheduled to see an ophthalmologist. I think it is reasonable for close followup of her visual symptoms progress. However, I certainly would not take any corrective measures at this point as I suspect her vision will improve gradually.I discussed with the patient that with respect to her back pain certainly the Neurontin is relatively at low dose and this could be increased further. I wanted her to start taking the Neurontin 300 mg per day and then 300 mg b.i.d. after one week. She will call me in approximately three weeks' time to let me know how she is doing and if needed we will titrate up further.She was apparently given some baclofen by her internist and I think this is not unreasonable. I definitely hope to get her off the Percocet in the future.IMPRESSION:1. Guillain-Barre Miller-Fisher variant.2. Hypertension.3. Diabetes mellitus.4. Stroke.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. The patient is to start taking aspirin 162 mg per day.2. Followup with ophthalmology.3. Increase Neurontin to 300 mg per day x 1 week and then 300 mg b.i.d.4. Followup by phone in three to four weeks.5. Followup in this clinic in approximately two months' time.6. Call for any questions or problems."

Upon neutral gaze the left eye deviated laterally and inferiorly. There was complete ptosis OS. On downward gaze their was intorsion OS. The left eye could not move superiorly, medially or effectively downward, but could move laterally. EOM were full OD. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor, Coordination, Station and Gait testing were unremarkable. Sensory exam revealed decreased pinprick and light touch below T9 (old). Muscle stretch reflexes were increased (3+/3+) in both lower extremities and there were bilateral babinski signs (old). The upper extremity reflexes were symmetrical (2/2). Cardiovascular exam revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm and lung sounds were coarse bilaterally. The rest of the general exam was unremarkable.LAB: CBC, PT/PTT, General Screen were unremarkable except for a BUN 21mg/DL. CSF: protein 88mg/DL, glucose 58mg/DL, RBC 2800/mm3, WBC 1/mm3. ANA, RF, TSH, FT4 were WNL.IMPRESSION: CN3 palsy and loss of vision. Differential diagnosis: temporal arteritis, aneurysm, intracranial mass.COURSE: The outside Brain CT revealed a tortuous left MCA. A four-vessel cerebral angiogram revealed a dolichoectatic basilar artery and tortuous LICA. There was no evidence of aneursym. Transesophageal Echocardiogram revealed atrial enlargement only. Neuroopthalmologic evaluation revealed: Loss of color vision and visual acuity OS, RAPD OS, bilateral optic disk pallor (OS > OD), CN3 palsy and bilateral temporal field loss, OS >> OD . ESR, CRP, MRI were recommended to rule out temporal arteritis and intracranial mass. ESR 29mm/Hr, CRP 4.3mg/DL (high) , The patient was placed on prednisone. Temporal artery biopsy showed no evidence of vasculitis. MRI scan could not be obtained due to patient weight. Sellar CT was done instead: coronal sections revealed sellar enlargement and upward bowing of the diaphragm sella suggesting a pituitary mass. In retrospect sellar enlargement could be seen on the angiogram X-rays. Differential consideration was given to cystic pituitary adenoma, noncalcified craniopharyngioma, or Rathke's cleft cyst with solid component. The patient refused surgery. He was seen in Neuroopthalmology Clinic 2/18/93 and was found to have mild recovery of vision OS and improved visual fields. Aberrant reinnervation of the 3rd nerve was noted as there was constriction of the pupil (OS) on adduction, downgaze and upgaze. The upper eyelid, OS, elevated on adduction and down gaze, OS. EOM movements were otherwise full and there was no evidence of ptosis. In retrospect he was felt to have suffered pituitary apoplexy in 11/92."

These findings were felt to represent a right subdural hematoma and possible subarachnoid hemorrhage.2/28/95 brain MRI revealed: 1)a small right-sided SDH, 2) Abnormal signal in the right occipital lobe with effacement of the gyri and sulci in the right PCA division most likely representing ischemic/vascular injury, 3)abnormal signal within the right basal ganglia/caudate nucleus consistent with ischemia, 4) abnormal signal in the uncal portion of the right frontal lobe consistent with contusion, 5) small parenchymal hemorrhage in the inferior anterior right temporal lobe, and 6) opacification of the right maxillary sinus.EEG, 2/28/95, was abnormal with occasional sharp transients in the left temporal region, and irregular (more or less continuous) right greater than left delta slow waves and decreased background activity in the right hemisphere: the findings were consistent with focal pathology on the right, seizure tendency in the left temporal region, and bilateral cerebral dysfunction. By the time of discharge, 4/17/95, she was verbalizing one or two words and required assistance with feeding and ambulation. She could not function independently."
338,Neurology,"The patient returns to our office today because of continued problems with her headaches. She was started on Zonegran on her last visit and she states that initially she titrated upto 100 mg q.h.s. Initially felt that the Zonegran helped, but then the pain in her head returned. It is an area of tenderness and sensitivity in her left parietal area. It is a very localized pain. She takes Motrin 400 mg b.i.d., which helped.She also had EMG/nerve conduction studies since she was last seen in our office that showed severe left ulnar neuropathy, moderate right ulnar neuropathy, bilateral mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel and diabetic neuropathy. She was referred to Dr. XYZ and will be seeing him on August 8, 2006.She was also never referred to the endocrine clinic to deal with her poor diabetes control. Her last hemoglobin A1c was 10.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes, hypertension, elevated lipids, status post CVA, and diabetic retinopathy.MEDICATIONS: Glyburide, Avandia, metformin, lisinopril, Lipitor, aspirin, metoprolol and Zonegran.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure was 140/70, heart rate was 76, respiratory rate was 18, and weight was 226 pounds. On general exam she has an area of tenderness on palpation in the left parietal region of her scalp. Neurological exam is detailed on our H&P form. Her neurological exam is within normal limits.IMPRESSION AND PLAN: For her headaches we are going to titrate Zonegran up to 200 mg q.h.s. to try to maximize the Zonegran therapy. If this is not effective, when she comes back on August 7, 2006 we will then consider other anticonvulsants such as Neurontin or Lyrica. We also discussed with Ms. Hawkins the possibility of nerve block injection; however, at this point she is not interested.She will be seeing Dr. XYZ for her neuropathies.We made an appointment in endocrine clinic today for a counseling in terms of better diabetes control and she is responsible for trying to get her referral from her primary care physician to go for this consult."
339,Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right temporal lobe intracerebral hemorrhage.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Right temporal lobe intracerebral hemorrhage.2. Possible tumor versus inflammatory/infectious lesion versus vascular lesion, pending final pathology and microbiology.PROCEDURES:1. Emergency right side craniotomy for temporal lobe intracerebral hematoma evacuation and resection of temporal lobe lesion.2. Biopsy of dura.3. Microscopic dissection using intraoperative microscope.SPECIMENS: Temporal lobe lesion and dura as well as specimen for microbiology for culture.DRAINS: Medium Hemovac drain.FINDINGS: Vascular hemorrhagic lesion including inflamed dura and edematous brain with significant mass effect, and intracerebral hematoma with a history of significant headache, probable seizures, nausea, and vomiting.ANESTHESIA: General.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Per Anesthesia.FLUIDS: One unit of packed red blood cells given intraoperatively.The patient was brought to the operating room emergently. This is considered as a life threatening admission with a hemorrhage in the temporal lobe extending into the frontal lobe and with significant mass effect.The patient apparently became hemiplegic suddenly today. She also had an episode of incoherence and loss of consciousness as well as loss of bowel/urine.She was brought to Emergency Room where a CT of the brain showed that she had significant hemorrhage of the right temporal lobe extending into the external capsule and across into the frontal lobe. There is significant mass effect. There is mixed density in the parenchyma of the temporal lobe.She was originally scheduled for elective craniotomy for biopsy of the temporal lobe to find out why she was having spontaneous hemorrhages. However, this event triggered her family to bring her to the emergency room, and this is considered a life threatening admission now with a significant mass effect, and thus we will proceed directly today for evacuation of ICH as well as biopsy of the temporal lobe as well as the dura.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was anesthetized by the anesthesiology team. Appropriate central line as well as arterial line, Foley catheter, TED, and SCDs were placed. The patient was positioned supine with a three-point Mayfield head pin holder. Her scalp was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. Her former incisional scar was barely and faintly noticed; however, through the same scalp scar, the same incision was made and extended slightly inferiorly. The scalp was resected anteriorly. The subdural scar was noted, and hemostasis was achieved using Bovie cautery. The temporalis muscle was reflected along with the scalp in a subperiosteal manner, and the titanium plating system was then exposed.The titanium plating system was then removed in its entirety. The bone appeared to be quite fused in multiple points, and there were significant granulation tissue through the burr hole covers.The granulation tissue was quite hemorrhagic, and hemostasis was achieved using bipolar cautery as well as Bovie cautery.The bone flap was then removed using Leksell rongeur, and the underlying dura was inspected. It was quite full. The 4-0 sutures from the previous durotomy closure was inspected, and more of the inferior temporal bone was resected using high-speed drill in combination with Leksell rongeur. The sphenoid wing was also resected using a high-speed drill as well as angled rongeur.Hemostasis was achieved on the fresh bony edges using bone wax. The dura pack-up stitches were noted around the periphery from the previous craniotomy. This was left in place.The microscope was then brought in to use for the remainder of the procedure until closure. Using a #15 blade, a new durotomy was then made. Then, the durotomy was carried out using Metzenbaum scissors, then reflected the dura anteriorly in a horseshoe manner, placed anteriorly, and this was done under the operating microscope. The underlying brain was quite edematous.Along the temporal lobe there was a stain of xanthochromia along the surface. Thus a corticectomy was then accomplished using bipolar cautery, and the temporal lobe at this level and the middle temporal gyrus was entered. The parenchyma of the brain did not appear normal. It was quite vascular. Furthermore, there was a hematoma mixed in with the brain itself. Thus a core biopsy was then performed in the temporal tip. The overlying dura was inspected and it was quite thickened, approximately 0.25 cm thick, and it was also highly vascular, and thus a big section of the dura was also trimmed using bipolar cautery followed by scissors, and several pieces of this vascularized dura was resected for pathology. Furthermore, sample of the temporal lobe was cultured.Hemostasis after evacuation of the intracerebral hematoma using controlled suction as well as significant biopsy of the overlying dura as well as intraparenchymal lesion was accomplished. No attempt was made to enter into the sylvian fissure. Once hemostasis was meticulously achieved, the brain was inspected. It still was quite swollen, known that there was still hematoma in the parenchyma of the brain. However, at this time it was felt that since there is no diagnosis made intraoperatively, we would need to stage this surgery further should it be needed once the diagnosis is confirmed. DuraGen was then used for duraplasty because of the resected dura. The bone flap was then repositioned using Lorenz plating system. Then a medium Hemovac drain was placed in subdural space. Temporalis muscle was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl. The galea was then reapproximated using inverted 2-0 Vicryl. The scalp was then reapproximated using staples. The head was then dressed and wrapped in a sterile fashion.She was witnessed to be extubated in the operating room postoperatively, and she followed commands briskly. The pupils are 3 mm bilaterally reactive to light. I accompanied her and transported her to the ICU where I signed out to the ICU attending."
340,Neurology,"REASON FOR ADMISSION: Hepatic encephalopathy.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51-year-old Native American male with known alcohol cirrhosis who presented to the emergency room after an accidental fall in the bathroom. He said that he was doing fine prior to that and denied having any complaints. He was sitting watching TV and he felt sleepy. So, he went to the bathroom to urinate before going to bed and while he was trying to lift the seat, he tripped and fell and hit his head on the back. His head hit the toilet seat. Then, he started having bleeding and had pain in the area with headache. He did not lose consciousness as far as he can tell. He went and woke up his sister. This happened somewhere between 10:30 and 11 p.m. His sister brought a towel and covered the laceration on the back of his head and called EMS, who came to his house and brought him to the emergency room, where he was found to have a laceration on the back of his head, which was stapled and a CT of the head was obtained and ruled out any acute intracranial pathology. On his lab work, his ammonia was found to be markedly elevated at 106. So, he is being admitted for management of this. He denied having any abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, GI bleed, hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. He said he has been taking his medicines, but he could not recall those. He denied having any symptoms prior to this fall. He said earlier today he also fell. He also said that this was an accidental fall caused by problem with his walker. He landed on his back at that time, but did not have any back pain afterwards.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Liver cirrhosis caused by alcohol. This is per the patient.2. He thinks he is diabetic.3.

Film was reviewed. The report mentioned, status post frontal craniotomy and a small focus of encephalomalacia involving the left frontal lobe. This is likely consistent with residuals from his previous head injury. There is also mild generalized atrophy and changes consistent with chronic small vessel disease. No other findings on his CT. The skull is unremarkable except for the surgery changes. No acute abnormalities overall.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:1. Hepatic encephalopathy. Trigger is unclear at this time. Could be noncompliance. No evidence of GI bleed and his electrolytes are normal. I am not sure if he is taking any sedatives, as he does not recall the medication that he is on. The patient will be admitted to the hospital for management. He will be started on lactulose. I will give him 30 mL every two hours until he has a bowel movement. Then, we will adjust the dose to target three bowel movements daily and we will monitor his ammonia level and ensure that it is trending down. We will monitor his electrolyte and correct as needed and I will hydrate him, as hypovolemia is also a possible trigger. We will obtain an ultrasound of his abdomen to see if there is any ascites. At this time, there is no clinical evidence of SBP, but if he develops any fever may consider tapping his belly if there is ascites to rule out that possibility.2. Thrombocytopenia likely due to cirrhosis. We will monitor the level. No need for transfusion at this time.3. Macrocytosis also due to liver disease. I will check his vitamin levels, however, to ensure that he does not need any supplementation.4. History of diabetes as per the patient. His glucose is 105. This can be clarified in the morning with his primary care physician. We will monitor his glucose for now.5. Skull laceration. This was stapled by the ER physician and we will watch it for now, appear to be stable. No evidence of any other trauma.6. We will watch him on the telemetry floor to ensure that he has no arrhythmias leading to his two falls, which appear to be incidental as per the patient.7. Right-sided hemiparesis appear to be chronic and not an acute issue. The patient already has a walker at home.8. We can try to obtain more information in the morning about his past medical history, medication, etc., from his family and/or his primary care physician at Sacaton.Time spent in evaluation and management of this patient in the emergency room exceeds 70 minutes."

342,Neurology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: ""A lot has been thrown at me.""The patient is interviewed with husband in room.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 69-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of Huntington disease, who presented to Hospital four days ago after an overdose of about 30 Haldol tablets 5 mg each and Tylenol tablet 325 mg each, 40 tablets. She has been on the medical floor for monitoring and is medically stable and was transferred to the psychiatric floor today. The patient states she had been thinking about suicide for a couple of weeks. Felt that her Huntington disease had worsened and she wanted to spare her family and husband from trouble. Reports she has been not socializing with her family because of her worsening depression. Husband notes that on Monday after speaking to Dr. X, they had been advised to alternate the patient's Pamelor (nortriptyline) to every other day because the patient was reporting dry mouth. They did as they have instructed and husband feels this may have had some factor on her worsening depression. The patient decided to ingest the pills when her husband went to work on Friday. She thought Friday would be a good day because there would be less medical people working so her chances of receiving medical care would be lessened. Her husband left around 7 in the morning and returned around 11 and found her sleeping. About 30 minutes after his arrival, he found the empty bottles and woke up the patient to bring her to the hospital.She says she wishes she would have died, but is happy she is alive and is currently not suicidal because she notes her sons may be have to be tested for the Huntington gene. She does not clearly explain how this has made her suicidality subside.This is the third suicide attempt in the last two months for this patient. About two months ago, the patient took an overdose of Tylenol and some other medication, which the husband and the patient are not able to recall. She was taken to Southwest Memorial Hermann Hospital. A few weeks ago, the patient tried to shoot herself and the gun was fired and there is a blow-hole in the floor. Husband locked the gun after that and she was taken to Bellaire Hospital. The patient has had three psychiatric admissions in the past two months, two to Southwest Memorial and one to Bellaire Hospital for 10 days. She sees Dr. X once or twice weekly. He started seeing her after her first suicide attempt.The patient's husband and the patient state that until March 2009, the patient was independent, was driving herself around and was socially active. Since then she has had worsening of her Huntington symptoms including short-term memory loss. At present, the patient could not operate the microwave or operate her cell phone and her husband says that she is progressively more withdrawn, complains about anxiety, and complains about shortness of breath. The patient notes that she has had depressive symptoms of quitting social life, the patient being withdrawn for the past few months and excessive worry about her Huntington disease.The patient's mother passed away 25 years ago from Huntington's. Her grandmother passed away 50 years ago and two brothers also passed away of Huntington's. The patient has told her husband that she does not want to go that way. The patient denies auditory or visual hallucinations, denies paranoid ideation. The husband and the patient deny any history of manic or hypomanic symptoms in the past.PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: As per the HPI, this is her third suicide attempt in the last two months and started seeing Dr. X. She has a remote history of being on Lexapro for depression.MEDICATIONS: Her medications on admission, alprazolam 0.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Artane 2 mg p.o. b.i.d., Haldol 2.5 mg p.o. t.i.d., Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily, nortriptyline 50 mg p.o. daily. Husband has stated that the patient's chorea becomes better when she takes Haldol. Alprazolam helps her with anxiety symptoms.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Huntington disease, symptoms of dementia and hypertension. She has an upcoming appointment with the Neurologist. Currently, does have a primary care physician and _______ having an outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. X, and her current Neurologist, Dr. Y.ALLERGIES: CODEINE AND KEFLEX.FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: Strong family history for Huntington disease as per the HPI. Mother and grandmother died of Huntington disease. Two young brothers also had Huntington disease.FAMILY PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: The patient denies history of depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, or suicide attempts.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband of 48 years. She used to be employed as a registered nurse. Her husband states that she does have a pattern of self-prescribing for minor illness, but does not think that she has ever taken muscle relaxants or sedative medications without prescriptions. She rarely drinks socially. She denies any illicit substance usage. Her husband reportedly gives her medication daily. Has been proactive in terms of seeking mental health care and medical care. The patient and husband report that from March 2009, she has been relatively independent, more socially active.MENTAL STATUS EXAM: This is an elderly woman appearing stated age. Alert and oriented x4 with poor eye contact. Appears depressed, has psychomotor retardation, and some mild involuntary movements around her lips. She is cooperative.

343,Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: Ms. ABC is a 67-year-old woman with adult hydrocephalus who returns to clinic for a routine evaluation. She comes to clinic by herself.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: She has been followed for her hydrocephalus since 2002. She also had an anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion from C3 though C5 in March 2007. She was last seen by us in clinic in March 2008 and she was experiencing little bit of head fullness and ringing in the ears at that time; however, we decided to leave her shunt setting at 1.0. We wanted her to followup with Dr. XYZ regarding the MRI of the cervical spine. Today, she tells me that with respect to her bladder last week she had some episodes of urinary frequency, however, this week she is not experiencing the same type of episodes. She reports no urgency, incontinence, and feels that she completely empties her bladder when she goes. She does experience some leakage with coughing. She wears the pad on a daily basis. She does not think that her bladder has changed much since we saw her last. With respect to her thinking and memory, she reports no problems at this time. She reports no headaches at this time. With respect to her walking and balance, she says that it feels worse. In the beginning of May, she had a coughing spell and at that time she developed buttock pain, which travels down the legs. She states that her leg often feel like elastic and she experiences a tingling radiculopathy. She says that this tingling is constant and at times painful. She feels that she is walking slower for this reason. She does not use the cane at this time. Most of the time, she is able to walk over uneven surfaces. She is able to walk up and down stairs and has no trouble getting in and out of a car.MEDICATIONS: Rhinocort 32 mg two sprays a day, Singulair 10 mg once a day, Xyzal 5 mg in the morning, Spiriva once a day, Advair twice a day, Prevacid 30 mg twice a day, Os-Cal 500 mg once a day, multivitamin once a day, and aspirin 81 mg a day.MAJOR FINDINGS: On exam today, this is a pleasant 67-year-old woman who comes back from the clinic waiting area with little difficulty. She is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.The shunt site is clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 1.0.Mental Status: Assessed and appears intact for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge. Her Mini-Mental Status exam score was 26/30 when attention was tested with calculations and 30/30 when attention was tested with spelling.Cranial Nerves: Extraocular movements are somewhat inhibited. She does not display any nystagmus at this time. Facial movement, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement are all intact.Gait: Assessed using the Tinetti assessment tool, which showed a balance score of 13/16 and a gait score of 11/12 for a total score of 24/28.ASSESSMENT: Ms. ABC has been experiencing difficulty with walking over the past several months.PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:1. Hydrocephalus.2. Cervical stenosis and retrolisthesis.3. Neuropathy in the legs.PLAN: Before we recommend anything more, we would like to get a hold of the notes from Dr. XYZ to try to come up with a concrete plan as to what we can do next for Ms. ABC. We believe that her walking is most likely not being effected by the hydrocephalus. We would like to see her back in clinic in two and a half months or so. We also talked to her about having her obtain cane training so that she knows how to properly use her cane, which she states she does have one. I suggested that she use the cane at her on discretion."
344,Neurology,"CC: Gait difficulty.HX: This 59 y/o RHF was admitted with complaint of gait difficulty. The evening prior to admission she noted sudden onset of LUE and LLE weakness. She felt she favored her right leg, but did not fall when walking. She denied any associated dysarthria, facial weakness, chest pain, SOB, visual change, HA, nausea or vomiting.PMH: tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, skull fx 1954, HTN, HA.MEDS: none on day of exam.SHX: editorial assistant at newspaper, 40pk-yr Tobacco, no ETOH/Drugs.FHX: noncontributoryADMIT EXAM: P95 R20, T36.6, BP169/104MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria, Naming-comprehension-reading intact. Euthymic with appropriate affect.CN: Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light, Fundi flat, VFFTC, EOMI, Face symmetric with intact sensation, Gag-shrug-corneal reflexes intact, Tongue ML with full ROMMotor: Full strength throughout right side. Mildly decreased left grip and left extensor hallucis longus. Biceps/Triceps/Wrist flexors and extensor were full strength on left. However she demonstrated mild LUE pronator drift and had difficulty standing on her LLE despite full strength on bench testing of the LLE.Sensory: No deficit to PP/T/Vib/Prop/ LTCoord: decreased speed and magnitude of FNF, Finger tapping and HKS, on left side only.Station: mild LUE upward drift.Gait: tendency to drift toward the left. Difficulty standing on LLE.Reflexes were symmetric, plantar responses were flexor bilaterally.Gen exam unremarkable.COURSE: Admit Labs: ESR, PT/PTT, GS, UA, EKG, and HCT were unremarkable. Hgb 13.9, Hct 41%, Plt 280k, WBC 5.5.The patient was diagnosed with a probable lacunar stroke and entered into the TOAST study (Trial of ORG10172[a low molecular weight heparin] in Acute Stroke Treatment).Carotid Duplex: 16-49%RICA and 0-15%LICA stenosis with anterograde vertebral artery flow, bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and a left to right shunt. There was no evidence of blood clot.Hospital course: 5 days after admission the patient began to complain of proximal LLE and left flank pain. On exam, she had weakness of the quadriceps and hip flexors of the LLE. Her pain increased with left hip flexion. In addition, she complained of paresthesias about the lateral aspect of the medial anterior left thigh; and upon on sensory testing, she had decreased PP/TEMP sensation in a left femoral nerve distribution. She denied any back/neck pain and the rest of her neurologic exam remained unchanged from admission.Abdominal CT Scan, 2/4/96, revealed a large left retroperitoneal iliopsoas hematoma.Hgb 8.9g/dl. She was transfused with 4 units of pRBCs. She underwent surgical decompression and evacuation of the hematoma via a posterior flank approach on 2/6/96. Her postoperative course was uncomplicated. She was discharged home on ASA.At follow-up, on 2/23/96, she complained of left sided paresthesias (worse in the LLE than in the LUE) and feeling of ""swollen left foot."" These symptoms had developed approximately 1 month after her stroke. Her foot looked normal and her UE strength was 5/4+ proximally and distally, and LE strength 5/4+ proximally and 5/5- distally. She was ambulatory. There was no evidence of LUE upward drift. A somatosensory evoked potential study revealed an absent N20 and normal P14 potentials. This was suggestive of a lesion involving the right thalamus which might explain her paresthesia/dysesthesia as part of a Dejerine-Roussy syndrome."
345,Neurology,"CC: RLE weakness.HX: This 42y/o RHM was found 2/27/95 slumped over the steering wheel of the Fed Ex truck he was driving. He was cyanotic and pulseless according to witnesses. EMT evaluation revealed him to be in ventricular fibrillation and he was given epinephrine, lidocaine, bretylium and electrically defibrillated and intubated in the field. Upon arrival at a local ER his cardiac rhythm deteriorated and he required more than 9 counter shocks (defibrillation) at 360 joules per shock, epinephrine and lidocaine. This had no effect. He was then given intracardiac epinephrine and a subsequent electrical defibrillation placed him in atrial fibrillation. He was then taken emergently to cardiac catherization and was found to have normal coronary arteries. He was then admitted to an intensive care unit and required intraortic balloon pump pressure support via the right gorin. His blood pressure gradually improved and his balloon pump was discontinued on 5/5/95. Recovery was complicated by acute renal failure and liver failure. Initail CK=13,780, the CKMB fraction was normal at 0.8.On 3/10/95, the patient experienced CP and underwent cardiac catherization. This time he was found to have a single occlusion in the distal LAD with association inferior hypokinesis. Subsequent CK=1381 and CKMB=5.4 (elevated). The patient was amnestic to the event and for 10 days following the event. He was transferred to UIHC for cardiac electrophysiology study.MEDS: Nifedipine, ASA, Amiodarone, Capoten, Isordil, Tylenol, Darvocet prn, Reglan prn, Coumadin, KCL, SLNTG prn, CaCO3, Valium prn, Nubain prn.PMH: hypercholesterolemia.FHX: Father alive age 69 with h/o TIAs. Mother died age 62 and had CHF, A-Fib, CAD. Maternal Grandfather died of an MI and had h/o SVT. Maternal Grandmother had h/o SVT.SHX: Married, 7 children, driver for Fed Ex. Denied tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use.EXAM: BP112/74 HR64 RR16 Afebrile.MS: A&O to person, place and time. Euthymic with appropriate affect.CN: unremarkable.Motor: Hip flexion 3/5, Hip extension 5/5, Knee flexion5/5, Knee extension 2/5, Plantar flexion, extension, inversion and eversion 5/5. There was full strength thoughout BUE.Sensory: decreased PP/Vib/LT/TEMP about anterior aspect of thigh and leg in a femoral nerve distribution.Coord: poor and slowed HKS on right due to weakness.Station: no drift or Romberg sign.Gait: difficulty bearing weight on RLE.Reflexes: 1+/1+ throughout BUE. 0/2 patellae. 2/2 archilles. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally.COURSE: MRI Pelvis, 3/28/95, revealed increased T1 weighted signal within the right iliopsoas suggestive of hematoma. An intra-osseous lipoma was incidentally notice in the right sacrum. Neuropsychologic assessment showed moderately compromised anterograde verbal memory, and temporal orientation and retrograde recall were below expectations. These findings were consistent with mesial temporal dysfunction secondary to anoxic injury and were mild in lieu of his history. He underwent implantation of a Medtronic internal cardiac difibrillator. His cardiac electrophysiology study found no inducible ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. He suffered mild to moderate permanent RLE weakness, especially involving the quadriceps. His femoral nerve compression had been present to long to warrant decompression. EMG/NCV studies revealed severe axonal degeneration."
346,Neurology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right shoulder pain.HISTORY: The patient is a pleasant, 31-year-old, right-handed, white female who injured her shoulder while transferring a patient back on 01/01/02. She formerly worked for Veteran's Home as a CNA. She has had a long drawn out course of treatment for this shoulder. She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002. She had ongoing pain and was evaluated by Dr. X who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy. He also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms. He then referred her to ABCD who did EMG testing, demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out. MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03. She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X. She comes to me for impairment rating. She has no chronic health problems otherwise, fevers, chills, or general malaise. She is not working. She is right-hand dominant. She denies any prior history of injury to her shoulder.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Negative aside from above.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.SOCIAL HISTORY: Please see above.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative aside from above.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: A pleasant, age appropriate woman, moderately overweight, in no apparent distress. Normal gait and station, normal posture, normal strength, tone, sensation and deep tendon reflexes with the exception of 4+/5 strength in the supraspinatus musculature on the right. She has decreased motion in the right shoulder as follows. She has 160 degrees of flexion, 155 degrees of abduction, 35 degrees of extension, 25 degrees of adduction, 45 degrees of internal rotation and 90 degrees of external rotation. She has a positive impingement sign on the right.ASSESSMENT: Right shoulder impingement syndrome, right suprascapular neuropathy.DISCUSSION: With a reasonable degree of medical certainty, she is at maximum medical improvement and she does have an impairment based on AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition. The reason for this impairment is the incident of 01/01/02. For her suprascapular neuropathy, she is rated as a grade IV motor deficit which I rate as a 13% motor deficit. This is multiplied by a maximum upper extremity impairment for involvement of the suprascapular nerve of 16% which produces a 2% impairment of the upper extremity when the two values are multiplied together, 2% impairment of the upper extremity. For her lack of motion in the shoulder she also has additional impairment on the right. She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder flexion. She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder abduction. She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder adduction. She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder extension. There is no impairment for findings in shoulder external rotation. She has a 3% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder internal rotation. Thus the impairment due to lack of motion in her shoulder is a 6% impairment of the upper extremity. This combines with the 2% impairment of the upper extremity due to weakness in the suprascapular nerve root distribution to produce an 8% impairment of the upper extremity which in turn is a 5% impairment of the whole person based on the AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition, stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty."
347,Neurology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Headache.HPI: This is a 24-year-old man who was seen here originally on the 13th with a headache and found to have a mass on CT scan. He was discharged home with a follow up to neurosurgery on the 14th. Apparently, an MRI the next day showed that the mass was an aneurysm and he is currently scheduled for an angiogram in preparation for surgery. He has had headaches since the 13th and complains now of some worsening of his pain. He denies photophobia, fever, vomiting, and weakness of the arms or legs.PMH: As above.MEDS: Vicodin.ALLERGIES: None.PHYSICAL EXAM: BP 180/110 Pulse 65 RR 18 Temp 97.5.Mr. P is awake and alert, in no apparent distress.HEENT: Pupils equal, round, reactive to light, oropharynx moist, sclera clear. Neck: Supple, no meningismus.Lungs: Clear.Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, gallop, or rub. Abdomen: Benign.Neuro: Awake and alert, motor strength normal, no numbness, normal gait, DTRs normal. Cranial nerves normal. COURSE IN THE ED: Patient had a repeat head CT to look for an intracranial bleed that shows an unchanged mass, no blood, and no hydrocephalus. I recommended an LP but he prefers not to have this done. He received morphine for pain and his headache improved. I've recommended admission but he has chosen to go home and come back in the morning for his scheduled angiogram. He left the ED against my advice. IMPRESSION: Headache, improved. Intracranial aneurysm.PLAN: The patient will return tomorrow am for his angiogram."
348,Neurology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Intractable epilepsy, here for video EEG.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 9-year-old male who has history of global developmental delay and infantile spasms. Ultimately, imaging study shows an MRI with absent genu of the corpus callosum and thinning of the splenium of the corpus callosum, showing a pattern of cerebral dysgenesis. He has had severe global developmental delay, and is nonverbal. He can follow objects with his eyes, but has no ability to interact with his environment to any great degree. He has noted if any purposeful use of the hands. He has abnormal movements constantly, which are more choreiform and dystonic. He has spastic quadriparesis, which is variable at times. The patient is unable to sit or stand, and receives all his nutrition via G-tube.The patient began having seizures in infancy presenting as infantile spasms. I began seeing him at 20 months of age. At that point, he had undergone workup in Seattle, Washington and then was seeing Dr. X, child neurologist in Mexico, who started Vigabatrin for infantile spasms. The patient had benefit from this medication, and was doing well at that time with regard to that seizure type. He initially was on phenobarbital, which failed to give him benefit. He continued on phenobarbital; however, for a long period time thereafter. The patient then began having more tonic seizures after his episodic spasms had subsided, and failed several medication trials including valproic acid, Topamax, and Zonegran at least briefly. Upon starting Lamictal, he began to have benefit and then actually had 1-year seizure freedom before having an isolated seizure or 2. Over the next 6 months to a year, he only had few further seizures, and was doing well in a general sense. It was more recently that he began having new seizure events that have not responded to higher doses of Lamictal up to 15 mg/kg/day. These events manifest as tonic spells with eye deviation and posturing. Mother reports flexion of the upper extremities, extension with lower extremities. During that time, he is not able to cry or say any sounds. These events last from seconds to minutes, and occur at least multiple times per week. There are times where he has none for a few days and other times where he has multiple days in a row with events. He has another event manifesting as flexion of the upper extremities and extension lower extremities where he turns red and cries throughout. He may vomit after these episodes, then seems to calm down. It is unclear whether this is a seizure or whether the patient is still responsive.MEDICATIONS: The patient's medications include Lamictal for a total of 200 mg twice a day. It is a 150 mg tablet and 25 mg tablets. He is on Zonegran using 25 mg capsules 2 capsules twice daily, and baclofen 10 mg three times day. He has other medications including the Xopenex and Atrovent.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: At this time is negative any fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal complaints, rashes, arthritis, or arthralgias. No respiratory or cardiovascular complaints. He has no change in his skills at this point.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: The patient is a slender male who is microcephalic. He has EEG electrodes in place and is on the video EEG at that time.HEENT: His oropharynx shows no lesions.NECK: Supple without adenopathy.CHEST: Clear to auscultation.CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.ABDOMEN: Benign with G-tube in place.EXTREMITIES: Reveal no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.NEUROLOGICAL: The patient is alert and has bilateral esotropia. He is able to fix and follow objects briefly. He is unable to reach for objects. He exhibits constant choreiform movements when excited. These are more prominent in the upper extremities and lower extremities. He has some dystonic posture with flexion of the wrist and fingers bilaterally. He also has plantar flexion at the ankles bilaterally. His cranial nerves reveal that his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact other than bilateral esotropia. His face moves symmetrically. Palate elevates in midline. Hearing appears intact bilaterally.Motor exam reveals dystonic and variable tone, overall there is mild in spasticity both upper and lower extremities as described above. He has clonus at the ankles bilaterally, and some valgus contracture of the ankles. His sensation is intact to light touch bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2 to 3+ bilaterally.IMPRESSION/PLAN: This is a 9-year-old male with congenital brain malformation and intractable epilepsy. He has microcephaly as well as dystonic cerebral palsy. He had a re-emergence of seizures, which are difficult to classify, although some sound like tonic episodes and others are more concerning for non-epileptic phenomenon, such as discomfort. He is admitted for video EEG to hopefully capture both of these episodes and further clarify the seizure type or types. He will remain hospitalized for probably at least 48 hours to 72 hours. He could be discharged sooner if multiple events are captured. His medications, we will continue his current dose of Zonegran and Lamictal for now. Both of these medications are very long acting, discontinuing them while in the hospital may simply result in severe seizures after discharge."
349,Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: Followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and L4-L5 posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ABC returns today for followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion on 06/08/07.Preoperatively, her symptoms, those of left lower extremity are radicular pain.She had not improved immediately postoperatively. She had a medial breech of a right L4 pedicle screw. We took her back to the operating room same night and reinserted the screw. Postoperatively, her pain had improved.I had last seen her on 06/28/07 at which time she was doing well. She had symptoms of what she thought was ""restless leg syndrome"" at that time. She has been put on ReQuip for this.She returned. I had spoken to her 2 days ago and she had stated that her right lower extremity pain was markedly improved. I had previously evaluated this for a pain possibly relating to deep venous thrombosis and ultrasound was negative. She states that she had recurrent left lower extremity pain, which was similar to the pain she had preoperatively but in a different distribution, further down the leg. Thus, I referred her for a lumbar spine radiograph and lumbar spine MRI and she presents today for evaluation.She states that overall, she is improved compared to preoperatively. She is ambulating better than she was preoperatively. The pain is not as severe as it was preoperatively. The right leg pain is improved. The left lower extremity pain is in a left L4 and L5 distribution radiating to the great toe and first web space on the left side.She denies any significant low back pain. No right lower extremity symptoms.No infectious symptoms whatsoever. No fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath. No drainage from the wound. No difficulties with the incision.FINDINGS: On examination, Ms. ABC is a pleasant, well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress. Alert and oriented x 3. Normocephalic, atraumatic. Respirations are normal and nonlabored. Afebrile to touch.Left tibialis anterior strength is 3 out of 5, extensor hallucis strength is 2 out of 5. Gastroc-soleus strength is 3 to 4 out of 5. This has all been changed compared to preoperatively. Motor strength is otherwise 4 plus out of 5. Light touch sensation decreased along the medial aspect of the left foot. Straight leg raise test normal bilaterally.The incision is well healed. There is no fluctuance or fullness with the incision whatsoever. No drainage.Radiographs obtained today demonstrate pedicle screw placement at L4 and L5 bilaterally without evidence of malposition or change in orientation of the screws.Lumbar spine MRI performed on 07/03/07 is also reviewed.It demonstrates evidence of adequate decompression at L4 and L5. There is a moderate size subcutaneous fluid collection seen, which does not appear compressive and may be compatible with normal postoperative fluid collection, especially given the fact that she had a revision surgery performed.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. ABC is doing relatively well status post L4 and L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation on 07/08/07. The case is significant for merely misdirected right L4 pedicle screw, which was reoriented with subsequent resolution of symptoms.I am uncertain with regard to the etiology of the symptoms. However, it does appear that the radiographs demonstrate appropriate positioning of the instrumentation, no hardware shift, and the MRI demonstrates only a postoperative suprafascial fluid collection. I do not see any indication for another surgery at this time.I would also like to hold off on an interventional pain management given the presence of the fluid collection to decrease the risk of infection.My recommendation at this time is that the patient is to continue with mobilization. I have reassured her that her spine appears stable at this time. She is happy with this.I would like her to continue ambulating as much as possible. She can go ahead and continue with ReQuip for the restless leg syndrome as her primary care physician has suggested. I have also her referred to Mrs. Khan at Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation for continued aggressive management.I will see her back in followup in 3 to 4 weeks to make sure that she continues to improve. She knows that if she has any difficulties, she may follow up with me sooner."
350,Neurology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient comes in today because of feeling lightheaded and difficulty keeping his balance. He denies this as a spinning sensation that he had had in the past with vertigo. He just describes as feeling very lightheaded. It usually occurs with position changes such as when he stands up from the sitting position or stands up from a lying position. It tends to ease when he sits down again, but does not totally resolve for another 15 to 30 minutes and he feels shaky and weak all over. Lorazepam did not help this sensation. His blood pressure has been up lately and his dose of metoprolol was increased. They feel these symptoms have gotten worse since metoprolol was increased.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Detailed on our H&P form. Positive for elevated cholesterol, diabetes, glaucoma, cataracts, hypertension, heart disease, vertigo, stroke in May of 2005, congestive heart failure, CABG, and cataract removed right eye.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Detailed on the H&P form.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His blood pressure sitting down was 180/80 with a pulse rate of 56. Standing up blood pressure was 160/80 with a pulse rate of 56. His general exam and neurological exam were detailed on our H&P form. Pertinent positives on his neurological exam were decreased sensation in his left face, and left arm and leg.IMPRESSION AND PLAN: This lightheaded, he exquisitely denies vertigo, the vertigo that he has had in the past. He states this is more of a lightheaded type feeling. He did have a mild blood pressure drop here in the office. We are also concerned that bradycardia might be contributing to his feeling of lightheadedness. We are going to suggest that he gets a Holter monitor and he should speak to his general practitioner as well as his cardiologist regarding the lightheaded feeling.We will schedule him for the Holter monitor and refer him back to his cardiologist."
351,Neurology,"CC: Rapidly progressive amnesia.HX: This 63 y/o RHM presented with a 1 year history of progressive anterograde amnesia. On presentation he could not remember anything from one minute to the next. He also had some retrograde memory loss, in that he could not remember the names of his grandchildren, but had generally preserved intellect, language, personality, and calculating ability. He underwent extensive evaluation at the Mayo Clinic and an MRI there revealed increased signal on T2 weighted images in the mesiotemporal lobes bilaterally. There was no mass affect. The areas mildly enhanced with gadolinium.PMH: 1) CAD; MI x 2 (1978 and 1979). 2) PVD; s/p aortic endarterectomy (3/1991). 3)HTN. 4)Bilateral inguinal hernia repair.FHX/SHX: Mother died of a stroke at age 58.

MRI and CT of the chest and CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of lymphadenopathy or tumor. EEG was normal awake and asleep. Antineuronal antibody screening was unremarkable. CSF studies were unremarkable and included varicella zoster, herpes zoster, HIV and HTLV testing, and cytology. The patient underwent stereotactic brain biopsy at the Mayo Clinic which showed inflammatory changes, but no organism or etiology was concluded. TFT, B12, VDRL, ESR, CRP, ANA, SPEP and Folate studies were unremarkable. Neuropsychologic testing revealed severe anterograde memory (verbal and visual)loss, and less severe retrograde memory loss. Most other cognitive abilities were well preserved and the findings were consistent with mesiotemporal dysfunction bilaterally.IMPRESSION: Limbic encephalitis secondary to cancer of unknown origin.He was last seen 7/26/96. MMSE 20/30 and category fluency 20 . Disinhibited affect. Mild right grasp reflex. The clinical course was benign and non-progressive, and unusual for such a diagnosis, though not unheard of ."
352,Neurology,"CC: Delayed motor development.HX: This 21 month old male presented for delayed motor development, ""jaw quivering"" and ""lazy eye."" He was an 8 pound 10 ounce product of a full term, uncomplicated pregnancy-labor-spontaneous vaginal delivery to a G3P3 married white female mother. There had been no known toxic intrauterine exposures. He had no serious illnesses or hospitalizations since birth. He sat independently at 7 months, stood at 11 months, crawled at 16 months, but did not cruise until 18 months.He currently cannot walk and easily falls. His gait is reportedly marked by left ""intoeing."" His upper extremity strength and coordination reportedly appear quite normal and he is able to feed himself, throw and transfer objects easily.

Both lower extremities could rotate outward to 90degrees. There was marked passive eversion at the ankles as well.Reflexes: 2+/2+ throughout.Musculoskeletal: pes planovalgus bilaterally.COURSE: CK normal. The parents decided to forego an MRI in 8/90. The patient returned 12/11/92 at age 4 years. He was ambulatory and able to run awkwardly. His general health had been good, but he showed signs developmental delay. Formal evaluation had tested his IQ at 87 at age 3.5 years. He was weakest on tasks requiring visual/motor integration and fine motor and visual discrimination skills. He was 6 months delayed in cognitive development at that time. On exam, age 4 years, he displayed mild right ankle laxity on eversion and inversion, but normal gait. The rest of the neurological exam was normal. Head circumference was 49.5cm (50%) and height and weight were in the 90th percentile. Fragile X analysis and karyotyping were unremarkable."
353,Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Low back pain.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Low back pain.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:1. Lumbar discogram L2-3.2. Lumbar discogram L3-4.3. Lumbar discogram L4-5.4. Lumbar discogram L5-S1.ANESTHESIA: IV sedation.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the Radiology Suite and placed prone onto a radiolucent table. The C-arm was brought into the operative field and AP, left right oblique and lateral fluoroscopic images of the L1-2 through L5-S1 levels were obtained. We then proceeded to prepare the low back with a Betadine solution and draped sterile. Using an oblique approach to the spine, the L5-S1 level was addressed using an oblique projection angled C-arm in order to allow for perpendicular penetration of the disc space. A metallic marker was then placed laterally and a needle entrance point was determined. A skin wheal was raised with 1% Xylocaine and an #18-gauge needle was advanced up to the level of the disc space using AP, oblique and lateral fluoroscopic projections. A second needle, #22-gauge 6-inch needle was then introduced into the disc space and with AP and lateral fluoroscopic projections, was placed into the center of the nucleus. We then proceeded to perform a similar placement of needles at the L4-5, L3-4 and L2-3 levels.A solution of Isovue 300 with 1 gm of Ancef was then drawn into a 10 cc syringe and without informing the patient of our injecting, we then proceeded to inject the disc spaces sequentially."
354,Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: This is an 83-year-old woman referred for diagnostic lumbar puncture for possible malignancy by Dr. X. She is accompanied by her daughter.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient' daughter tells me that over the last month the patient has gradually stopped walking even with her walker and her left arm has become gradually less functional. She is not able to use the walker because her left arm is so weak. She has not been having any headaches. She has had a significant decrease in appetite. She is known to have lung cancer, but Ms. Wilson does not know what kind. According to her followup notes, it is presumed non-small cell lung cancer of the left upper lobe of the lung. The last note I have to evaluate is from October 2008. CT scan from 12/01/2009 shows atrophy and small vessel ischemic change, otherwise a normal head CT, no mass lesion. I also reviewed the MRI from September 2009, which does not suggest normal pressure hydrocephalus and shows no mass lesion.Blood tests from 11/18/2009 demonstrate platelet count at 132 and INR of 1.0.MAJOR FINDINGS: The patient is a pleasant and cooperative woman who answers the questions the best she can and has difficulty moving her left arm and hand. She also has pain in her left arm and hand at a level of 8-9/10.VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 126/88, heart rate 70, respiratory rate 16, and weight 95 pounds.I screened the patient with questions to determine whether it is likely she has abnormal CSF pressure and she does not have any of the signs that would suggest this, so we performed the procedure in the upright position.PROCEDURE: Lumbar puncture, diagnostic (CPT 62270).PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Possible CSF malignancy.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: To be determined after CSF evaluation.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Lumbar puncture.ANESTHESIA: Local with 2% lidocaine at the L4-L5 level.SPECIMEN REMOVED: 15 cc of clear CSF.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None.DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: I explained the procedure, its rationale, risks, benefits, and alternatives to the patient and her daughter. The patient' daughter remained present throughout the procedure. The patient provided written consent and her daughter signed as witness to the consent.I located the iliac crest and spinous processes before the procedure and determined the level I planned for the puncture. During the procedure, I spoke constantly with the patient to explain what was happening and to warn when there might be pain or discomfort. The skin was prepped with chlorhexidine solution with the patient seated on the chair leaning forward with her face resting on the exam table. Using local anesthetic and aseptic technique, I inserted a 20-gauge spinal needle at the L4-L5 interspace and 15 cc of CSF was collected without difficulty.The patient tolerated the procedure well.ASSESSMENT: White blood cells 1, red blood cells 54, glucose 59, protein 51, Gram stain negative, bacterial culture negative after three days, and remaining tests pending."
355,Neurology,"PROCEDURE: Lumbar puncture with moderate sedation.INDICATION: The patient is a 2-year, 2-month-old little girl who presented to the hospital with severe anemia, hemoglobin 5.8, elevated total bilirubin consistent with hemolysis and weak positive direct Coombs test. She was transfused with packed red blood cells. Her hemolysis seemed to slow down. She also on presentation had indications of urinary tract infection with urinalysis significant for 2+ leukocytes, positive nitrites, 3+ protein, 3+ blood, 25 to 100 white cells, 10 to 25 bacteria, 10 to 25 epithelial cells on clean catch specimen. Culture subsequently grew out no organisms; however, the child had been pretreated with amoxicillin about x3 doses prior to presentation to the hospital. She had a blood culture, which was also negative. She was empirically started on presentation with the cefotaxime intravenously. Her white count on presentation was significantly elevated at 20,800, subsequently increased to 24.7 and then decreased to 16.6 while on antibiotics. After antibiotics were discontinued, she increased over the next 2 days to an elevated white count of 31,000 with significant bandemia, metamyelocytes and myelocytes present. She also had three episodes of vomiting and thus she is being taken to the procedure room today for a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis that may being inadvertently treated in treating her UTI.I discussed with The patient's parents prior to the procedure the lumbar puncture and moderate sedation procedures. The risks, benefits, alternatives, complications including, but not limited to bleeding, infection, respiratory depression. Questions were answered to their satisfaction. They would like to proceed.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After ""time out"" procedure was obtained, the child was given appropriate monitoring equipment including appropriate vital signs were obtained. She was then given Versed 1 mg intravenously by myself. She subsequently became sleepy, the respiratory monitors, end-tidal, cardiopulmonary and pulse oximetry were applied. She was then given 20 mcg of fentanyl intravenously by myself. She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Dr. X cleansed the patient's back in a normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution. She inserted a 22-gauge x 1.5-inch spinal needle in the patient's L3-L4 interspace that was carefully identified under my direct supervision. Clear fluid was not obtained initially, needle was withdrawn intact. The patient was slightly repositioned by the nurse and Dr. X reinserted the needle in the L3-L4 interspace position, the needle was able to obtain clear fluid, approximately 3 mL was obtained. The stylette was replaced and the needle was withdrawn intact and bandage was applied. Betadine solution was cleansed from the patient's back.During the procedure, there were no untoward complications, the end-tidal CO2, pulse oximetry, and other vitals remained stable. Of note, EMLA cream had also been applied prior procedure, this was removed prior to cleansing of the back.Fluid will be sent for a routine cell count, Gram stain culture, protein, and glucose.DISPOSITION: The child returned to room on the medical floor in satisfactory condition."
356,Neurology,"Briefly, the patient has a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy that is temporally related to the epidural anesthesia given to her in October of 2008.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 35-year-old woman who reports that on the 30th of October 2008, she had a rupture of her membranes at nine months of pregnancy, and was admitted to hospital and was given an epidural anesthetic. I do not have the records from this hospital admission, but apparently the epidural was administered for approximately 14 to 18 hours. She was sitting up during the epidural.She did not notice any difference in her lower extremities at the time she had the epidural; however, she reports that she was extremely sleepy and may not have been aware of any change in strength or sensation in her lower extremities at that time. She delivered on the 31st of October, by Cesarean section, because she had failed to progress and had pyrexia.She also had a Foley catheter placed at that time. On the 1st of November 2008, they began to mobilize her and it was at that time that she first noticed that she could not walk. She was aware that she could not move her legs at all, and then within a few days, she was aware that she could move toes in the left foot but could not move her right foot at all. Since that time, there has been a gradual improvement in strength to the point that she now has limited movement in her left leg and severely restricted movement in her right leg. She is not able to walk by herself, and needs assistance to stand. She was discharged from hospital after the Cesarean section on the 3rd of November. Unfortunately, we do not have the records and we do not know what the discussion was between the anesthesiologist and the patient at the time of discharge. She was then seen at ABC Hospital on November 05, 2008. She had an MRI scan of her spine, which showed no evidence of an abnormality, specifically there were no cord changes and no evidence of a hematoma. She also had an EMG study at that time by Dr. X, which was abnormal but not diagnostic and this was repeated again in December. At the present time, she also complains of a pressure in both her legs and in her thighs. She complains that her right foot hurts and that she has some hyperesthesia there. She has been taking gabapentin to try to reduce the discomfort, although she is on a very low dose and the effect is minimal. She has no symptoms in her arms, her bowel and bladder function is normal, and her bulbar function is normal. There is no problem with her vision, swallowing, or respiratory function.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Unremarkable except as noted above. She has seasonal allergies.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Gabapentin 300 mg b.i.d., Centrum once a day, and another multivitamin.ALLERGIES: She has no medication allergies, but does have seasonal allergies.FAMILY HISTORY: There is a family history of diabetes and hypertension. There is no family history of a neuropathy or other neurological disease. She has one child, a son, born on October 31, 2008.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a civil engineer, who currently works from home. She is working approximately half time because of limitations imposed on her by her disability, need to attend frequent physical therapy, and also the needs of looking after her baby. She does not smoke and does not drink and has never done either.GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: P 74, BP 144/75, and a pain score of 0.GENERAL: Her general physical examination was unremarkable.CARDIOVASCULAR: Normal first and second heart sound, regular pulse with normal volume.RESPIRATORY: Unremarkable, both lung bases were clear, and respiration was normal.GI: Unremarkable, with no organomegaly and normal bowel sounds.NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:MSE: The patient's orientation was normal, fund of knowledge was normal, memory was normal, speech was normal, calculation was normal, and immediate and long-term recall was normal. Executive function was normal.CRANIAL NERVES: The cranial nerve examination II through XII was unremarkable. Both disks were normal, with normal retina. Pupils were equal and reactive to light. Eye movements were full. Facial sensation and strength was normal. Bulbar function was normal. The trapezius had normal strength.MOTOR: Muscle tone showed a slight increase in tone in the lower extremities, with normal tone in the upper extremities. Muscle strength was 5/5 in all muscle groups in the upper extremities. In the lower extremities, the hip flexors were 1/5 bilaterally, hip extensors were 1/5 bilaterally, knee extension on the right was 1/5 and on the left was 3-/5, knee flexion was 2/5 on the right and 3-/5 on the left, foot dorsiflexion was 0/5 on the right and 1/5 on the left, foot plantar flexion was 4-/5 on the right and 4+/5 on the left, toe extension was 0/5 on the right and 4-/5 on the left, toe flexion was 4-/5 on the right and 4+/5 on the left.REFLEXES: Reflexes in the upper extremities were 2+ bilaterally. In the lower extremities, they were 0 bilaterally at the knee and ankles. The abdominal reflexes were present above the umbilicus and absent below the umbilicus. The plantar responses were mute. The jaw reflex was normal.SENSATION: Vibration was moderately decreased in the right great toe and was mildly decreased in the left great toe. There was a sensory level to light touch at approximately T7 posteriorly and approximately T9 anteriorly. There was a range of sensation, but clearly there was a decrease in sensation below this level but not complete loss of sensation. To pain, the sensory level is even less clear, but appeared to be at about T7 on the right side. In the lower extremities, there was a slight decrease in pin and light touch in the right great toe compared to the left. There was no evidence of allodynia or hyperesthesia. Joint position sense was mildly reduced in the right toe and normal on the left.COORDINATION: Coordination for rapid alternating movements and finger-to-nose testing was normal. Coordination could not be tested in the lower extremities.GAIT: The patient was unable to stand and therefore we were unable to test gait or Romberg's. There was no evidence of focal back tenderness.REVIEW OF OUTSIDE RECORDS: I have reviewed the records from ABC Hospital, including the letter from Dr. Y and the EMG report dated 12/17/2008 from Dr. X. The EMG report shows evidence of a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy below approximately T6. The lower extremity sensory responses are essentially normal; however, there is a decrease in the amplitude of the motor responses with minimal changes in latency. I do have the MRI of lumbar spine report from 11/06/2008 with and without contrast. This showed a minimal concentric disc bulge of L4-L5 without disc herniation, but was otherwise unremarkable. The patient brought a disc with a most recent MRI study; however, we were unable to open this on our computers. The verbal report is that the study was unremarkable except for some gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots. A Doppler of the lower extremities showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity. Chest x-ray showed some scoliosis on the lumbar spine, curve to the left, but no evidence of other abnormalities. A CT pelvis study performed on November 07, 2008 showed some nonspecific fluid in the subcutaneous fat of the back, posterior to L4 and L5 levels; however, there were no pelvic masses or other abnormalities. We were able to obtain an update of the report from the MRI of the lumbar spine with and without contrast dated 12/30/2008. The complete study included the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. There was diffuse enhancement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina that had increased in enhancement since prior exam in November. It was also reported that the patient was given intravenous methylprednisolone and this had had no effect on strength in her lower extremities.IMPRESSION: The patient has a condition that is temporarily related to the epidural injection she was given at the end of October 2008, prior to her Cesarean section. It appears she became aware of weakness within two days of the administration of the epidural, she was very tired during the epidural and may have missed some change in her neurological function. She was severely weak in both lower extremities, slightly worse on the right than the left. There has been some interval improvement in her strength since the beginning of November 2008. Her EMG study from the end of December is most consistent with a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy. The MRI findings of gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots would be most consistent with an inflammatory radiculitis most likely related to the epidural anesthesia or administration of the epidural. There had been no response to IV methylprednisolone given to her at ABC. The issue of having a lumbar puncture to look for evidence of inflammatory cells or an elevated protein had been discussed with her at both ABC and by myself. The patient did not wish to consider a lumbar puncture because of concerns that this might worsen her condition. At the present time, she is able to stand with aid but is unable to walk. There is no evidence on her previous EMG of a demyelinating neuropathy.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. The diagnostic issues were discussed with the patient at length. She is informed that this is still early in the course of the problem and that we expect her to show some improvement in her function over the next one to two years, although it is unclear as to how much function she will regain.2. She is strongly recommended to continue with vigorous physical therapy, and to continue with the plan to mobilize her as much as possible, with the goal of trying to get her ambulatory. If she is able to walk, she will need bilateral AFOs for her ankles, to improve her overall mobility. I am not prescribing these because at the present time she does not need them.3. We discussed increasing the dose of gabapentin. The paresthesias that she has may indicate that she is actually regaining some sensory function, although there is a concern that as recovery continues, she may be left with significant neuropathic pain. If this is the case, I have advised her to increase her gabapentin dose from 300 mg b.i.d. gradually up to 300 mg four times a day and then to 600 mg to 900 mg four times a day. She may need other neuropathic pain medications as needed. She will determine whether her current symptoms are significant enough to require this increase in dosage.4. The patient will follow up with Dr. Y and his team at ABC Hospital. She will also continue with physical therapy within the ABC system."
357,Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: This is a new patient evaluation for Mr. A. There is a malignant meningioma. He is referred by Dr. X.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: He said he has had two surgeries in 07/06 followed by radiation and then again in 08/07. He then had a problem with seizures, hemiparesis, has been to the hospital, developed C-diff, and is in the nursing home currently. He is unable to stand at the moment. He is unable to care for himself. I reviewed the information that was sent down with him from the nursing home which includes his medical history.MEDICATIONS: Keppra 1500 twice a day and Decadron 6 mg four times a day. His other medicines include oxycodone, an aspirin a day, Prilosec, Dilantin 300 a day, and Flagyl.FINDINGS: On examination, he is lying on the stretcher. He has oxygen on and has periods of spontaneous hyperventilation. He is unable to lift his right arm or right leg. He has an expressive dysphasia and confusion.I reviewed the imaging studies from summer from the beginning of 10/07, end of 10/07 as well as the current MRI he had last week. This shows that he has had progression of disease with recurrence along the surface of the brain and there is significant brain edema. This is a malignant meningioma by diagnosis.ASSESSMENT/PLAN: In summary, Mr. A has significant disability and is not independent currently. I believe that because of this that the likelihood of benefit from surgery is small and there is a very good chance that he would not be able to recover from surgery. I do not think that surgery will help his quality of life and a need to control the tumor would be dependent on another therapy impacting the tumor. Given that there are not good therapies and chemotherapy would be the option at the moment, and he certainly is not in a condition where chemotherapy would be given, I believe that surgery would not be in his best interest. I discussed this both with him, although it is not clear to me how much he understood, as well as his family."

He did well until the afternoon of admission when while moving the lawn he experienced lightheadedness, RUE dysfunction and expressive aphasia (could not get the words out). His wife took him to his local MD, and on the way there his symptoms resolved. His aphasia recurred at his physician's office and a CT scan of the brain revealed a left temporal mass. He was transferred to UIHC.PMH: HTN for many yearsMEDS: Vasotec and DyazideSHX/FHX: ETOH abuse (quit '92), 30pk-yr Cigarettes (quit '92)EXAM: BP158/92, HR91, RR16MS: Speech fluent without dysarthriaCN: no deficits notedMotor: no weakness or abnormal tone notedSensory: no deficits notedCoord: normalStation: no driftGait NDReflexes: 3+ throughout.

It has a peripheral dark rim on T1 and T2 with surrounding edema. This suggests a component of methemoglobin and hemosiderin within it. Slight peripheral enhancement was identified. There are two smaller foci of enhancement in the posterior parietal lobe on the right. There is nonspecific white matter foci within the pons and right thalamus. Impression: right temporoparietal hemorrhage, suggesting aneurysm or mass. The two smaller foci may suggest metastasis. The white matter changes probably reflect microvascular disease.3 Vessel cerebroangiogram, 8/31/92: Lobulated fusiform aneurysm off a peripheral branch of the left middle cerebral artery with slow flow into the vessel distal to the aneurysm.COURSE: The aneurysm was felt to be inoperable and he was discharged home on Dilantin, ASA, and Diltiazem."
359,Neurology,"CC: Progressive loss of color vision ODHX: 58 y/o female presents with a one year history of progressive loss of color vision. In the past two months she has developed blurred vision and a central scotoma OD. There are no symptoms of photopsias, diplopia, headache, or eye pain. There are no other complaints. There have been mild fluctuations of her symptoms, but her vision has never returned to its baseline prior to symptom onset one year ago.EXAM: Visual acuity with correction: 20/25+1 OD; 20/20-1 OS. Pupils were 3.5mm OU. There was a 0.8 log unit RAPD OD. Intraocular pressures were 25 and 24, OD and OS respectively; and there was an increase to 27 on upgaze OD, but no increase on upgaze OS. Optic disk pallor was evident OD, but not OS. Additionally, there was a small area of peripheral chorioretinal scarring in the inferotemporal area of the right eye. Foveal flicker fusion occurred at a frequency of 21.9 OD and 30.7 OS. Color plate testing scores: 6/14 OD and 10/14 OS. Goldman visual field examination showed an enlarged and deepened blind spot with an infero-temporal defect especially in the smaller diopters.IMPRESSION ON 2/6/89: Optic neuropathy/atrophy OD, rule out mass lesion affecting optic nerve. Particular attention was paid to the area of the optic canal, cavernous sinus and sphenoid sinus.BRAIN CT W/CONTRAST, 2/13/89: Enhancing calcified lesion in the posterior aspect of the right optic nerve, probable meningioma.MRI ORBITS W/ AND W/OUT GADOLINIUM CONTRAST, 4/26/89: 7x3mm irregular soft tissue mass just inferior and lateral to the optic nerve OD. The mass is just proximal to the orbital apex. There is relatively homogeneous enhancement of the mass. The findings are most consistent with meningioma.MRI 1995: Mild enlargement of tumor with possible slight extension into the right cavernous sinus.COURSE: Resection and biopsy were deferred due to risk of blindness, and suspicion that the tumor was a slow growing meningioma. 3 years after initial evaluation Hertel measurements indicated a 3mm proptosis OD. Visual field testing revealed gradual worsening of deficits seen on her initial Goldman visual field exam. There was greater red color desaturation of the temporal field OD. Visual acuity had decreased from 20/20 to 20/64, OD. All other deficits seen on her initial exam remained stable or slightly worsened. By 1996 she continued to be followed at 6 months intervals and had not undergone surgical resection."

Outside HCT showed hypodensities in the right putamen, left caudate, and at several subcortical locations (not specified).COURSE: MRI Brian Scan, 2/11/92 revealed an old lacunar infarct in the right basal ganglia, edema within the head of the left caudate nucleus suggesting an acute ischemic event, and arterial enhancement of the left MCA distribution suggesting slow flow. The latter suggested a vasculopathy such as Moya Moya, or fibromuscular dysplasia. HIV, ANA, Anti-cardiolipin Antibody titer, Cardiac enzymes, TFTs, B12, and cholesterol studies were unremarkable.She underwent a cerebral angiogram on 2/12/92. This revealed an occlusion of the left MCA just distal to its origin. The distal distribution of the left MCA filled on later films through collaterals from the left ACA. There was also an occlusion of the right MCA just distal to the temporal branch. Distal branches of the right MCA filled through collaterals from the right ACA. No other vascular abnormalities were noted. These findings were felt to be atypical but nevertheless suspicious of a large caliber vasculitis such as Moya Moya disease. She was subsequently given this diagnosis. Neuropsychologic testing revealed widespread cognitive dysfunction with particular impairment of language function. She had long latencies responding and understood only simple questions. Affect was blunted and there was distinct lack of concern regarding her condition. She was subsequently discharged home on no medications.In 9/92 she was admitted for sudden onset right hemiparesis and mental status change. Exam revealed the hemiparesis and in addition she was found to have significant neck lymphadenopathy.

Plantars were flexor, bilaterally.Gen Exam: unremarkable.COURSE: MRI Brain, 10/7/92, revealed: a large 6x5x6cm slightly heterogeneous, mostly isointense lesion on both T1 and T2 weighted images arising from the planum sphenoidale and olfactory groove. The mass extends approximately 3.6cm superior to the planum into both frontal regions with edema in both frontal lobes. The mass extends 2.5cm inferiorly involving the ethmoid sinuses with resultant obstruction of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses.It also extends into the superomedial aspect of the right maxillary sinus. There is probable partial encasement of both internal carotid arteries just above the siphon. The optic nerves are difficult to visualize but there is also probable encasement of these structures as well. The mass enhances significantly with gadolinium contrast. These finds are consistent with Meningioma.The patient underwent excision of this tumor by simultaneous bifrontal craniotomy and lateral rhinotomy following an intrasinus biopsy which confirmed the meningioma. Postoperatively, he lost visual acuity, OS, but this gradually returned to baseline. His 9/6/96 neuro-ophthalmology evaluation revealed visual acuity of 20/25-3 (OD) and 20/80-2 (OS). His visual fields continued to abnormal, but improved and stable when compared to 10/92. His anosmia never resolved."

366,Neurology,"This is a middle-aged male with increasing memory loss and history of Lyme disease.FINDINGS:There is a large intrasellar mass lesion producing diffuse expansion of the sella turcica. This mass lesions measures approximately 16 x 18 x 18mm (craniocaudal x AP x mediolateral) in size. The lesion extends into the left cavernous sinus along the inferior edge of the C3 segment of the left cavernous carotid artery obscuring the left cranial nerves III, IV and VI. The V1 and V2 branches however can be identified. There is intense enhancement of this lesion following gadolinium augmentation. There is a focal central area of nonenhancement which measures approximately 4mm in diameter. There is right-sided deviation of the infundibulum with mild convex bowing of this mass lesion into the suprasellar cistern, however, there is no impingement upon the optic chiasm. There is pressure erosion of the floor of the sella turcica bulging into the sphenoid sinus without a demonstrated cortical destruction or invasion of the sphenoid sinus.The lesion most likely represents a macroadenoma. The intense enhancement of the central area of hypointense signal raises the possibility a calcification suggesting a differential diagnosis of a late onset craniopharyngioma. The lesion is not considered consistent with a meningioma. CT imaging would be of benefit for exclusion of calcification.Normal flow within the carotid and vertebrobasilar circulation and there is no demonstrated aneurysm of the Circle of Willis.Normal cerebral hemispheres and normal cortical gray matter and white matter tracks. There are no white matter hyperintensities. There is normal enhancement of the dural sinuses and cortical veins.

375,Neurology,"CC: Difficulty with word finding.HX: This 27y/o RHF experienced sudden onset word finding difficulty and slurred speech on the evening of 2/19/96. She denied any associated dysphagia, diplopia, numbness or weakness of her extremities. She went to sleep with her symptoms on 2/19/96, and awoke with them on 2/20/96. She also awoke with a headache (HA) and mild neck stiffness. She took a shower and her HA and neck stiffness resolved. Throughout the day she continued to have difficulty with word finding and had worsening of her slurred speech. That evening, she began to experience numbness and weakness in the lower right face. She felt like there was a ""rubber-band"" wrapped around her tongue.For 3 weeks prior to presentation, she experienced transient episodes of a ""boomerang"" shaped field cut in the left eye. The episodes were not associated with any other symptoms. One week prior to presentation, she went to a local ER for menorrhagia. She had just resumed taking oral birth control pills one week prior to the ER visit after having stopped their use for several months. Local evaluation included an unremarkable carotid duplex scan. However, a HCT with and without contrast reportedly revealed a left frontal gyriform enhancing lesion. An MRI brain scan on 2/20/96 revealed nonspecific white matter changes in the right periventricular region. EEG reportedly showed diffuse slowing. CRP was reportedly ""too high"" to calibrate.MEDS: Ortho-Novum 7-7-7 (started 2/3/96), and ASA (started 2/20/96).PMH: 1)ventral hernia repair 10 years ago, 2)mild ""concussion"" suffered during a MVA; without loss of consciousness, 5/93, 3) Anxiety disorder, 4) One childbirth.FHX: She did not know her father and was not in contact with her mother.SHX: Lives with boyfriend.

Urine beta-hCG pregnancy and drug screen were negative. EKG, CXR and UA were negative.MRI brain, 2/21/96 revealed increased signal on T2 imaging in the periventricular white matter region of the right hemisphere. In addition, there were subtle T2 signal changes in the right frontal, right parietal, and left parietal regions as seen previously on her local MRI can. In addition, special FLAIR imaging showed increased signal in the right frontal region consistent with ischemia.She underwent Cerebral Angiography on 2/22/96. This revealed decreased flow and vessel narrowing the candelabra branches of the RMCA supplying the right frontal lobe. These changes corresponded to the areas of ischemic changes seen on MRI. There was also segmental narrowing of the caliber of the vessels in the circle of Willis. There was a small aneurysm at the origin of the LPCA. There was narrowing in the supraclinoid portion of the RICA and the proximal M1 and A1 segments. The study was highly suggestive of vasculitis.2/23/96, Neuro-ophthalmology evaluation revealed no evidence of retinal vasculitic change. Neuropsychologic testing the same day revealed slight impairment of complex attention only. She was started on Prednisone 60mg qd and Tagamet 400mg qhs.On 2/26/96, she underwent a right frontal brain biopsy. Pathologic evaluation revealed evidence of focal necrosis (stroke/infarct), but no evidence of vasculitis. Immediately following the brain biopsy, while still in the recovery room, she experienced sudden onset right hemiparesis and transcortical motor type aphasia. Initial HCT was unremarkable. An EEG was consistent with a focal lesion in the left hemisphere. However, a 2/28/96 MRI brain scan revealed new increased signal on T2 weighted images in a gyriform pattern from the left precentral gyrus to the superior frontal gyrus. This was felt consistent with vasculitis.She began q2month cycles of Cytoxan (1,575mg IV on 2/29/96. She became pregnant after her 4th cycle of Cytoxan, despite warnings to the contrary. After extensive discussions with OB/GYN it was recommended she abort the pregnancy. She underwent neuropsychologic testing which revealed no significant cognitive deficits. She later agreed to the abortion. She has undergone 9 cycles of Cytoxan ( one cycle every 2 months) as of 4/97. She had complained of one episode of paresthesias of the LUE in 1/97. MRI then showed no new signs ischemia."

Her RLE was spastic with sustained ankle clonus. There was dysesthetic sensory perception in the RUE. Jaw jerk and glabellar sign were present.MRI brain, 11/7/92, revealed multiple enhancing lesions in the peritrigonal region and white matter of the centrum semiovale. The right peritrigonal region is more prominent than on prior study. The left centrum semiovale lesion has less enhancement than previously. Multiple other white matter lesions are demonstrated on the right side, in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the anterior periventricular white matter, optic radiations and cerebellum. The peritrigonal lesions on both sides have increased in size since the 10/92 MRI. The findings were felt more consistent with demyelinating disease and less likely glioma. Post-viral encephalitis, Rapidly progressive demyelinating disease and tumor were in the differential diagnosis. Lumbar Puncture, 11/8/92, revealed: RBC 2, WBC 12 (12 lymphocytes), Glucose 57, Protein 51 (elevated), cytology and cultures were negative. HIV 1 titer was negative. Urine drug screen, negative. A stereotactic brain biopsy of the right parieto-occipital region was consistent with demyelinating disease. She was treated with Decadron 6mg IV qhours and Cytoxan 0.75gm/m2 (1.25gm).

Plantar responses were flexor.Gen Exam: Inremarkable. HEENT: unremarkable.COURSE: The patient continued Sinemet CR 25/100 1tab TID and was told to monitor orthostatic BP at home. The evaluating Neurologist became concerned that she may have Parkinsonism plus dysautonomia.She was seen again on 5/28/96 and reported no improvement in her condition. In addition she complained of worsening lightheadedness upon standing and had an episode, 1 week prior to 5/28/96, in which she was at her kitchen table and became unable to move. There were no involuntary movements or alteration in sensorium/mental status. During the episode she recalled wanting to turn, but could not. Two weeks prior to 5/28/96 she had an episode of orthostatic syncope in which she struck her head during a fall. She discontinued Sinemet 5 days prior to 5/28/96 and felt better. She felt she was moving slower and that her micrographia had worsened. She had had recent difficulty rolling over in bed and has occasional falls when turning. She denied hypophonia, dysphagia or diplopia.On EXAM: BP (supine)153/110 with HR 88. BP (standing)110/80 with HR 96. (+) Myerson's sign and mild hypomimia, but no hypophonia. There was normal blinking and EOM. Motor strength was full throughout. No resting tremor, but mild postural tremor present. No rigidity noted. Mild decrement on finger tapping noted. Reflexes were symmetric. No Babinski signs and no clonus. Gait was short stepped with mild anteroflexed posture. She was unable to turn on point. 3-4 step Retropulsion noted. The Parkinsonism had been unresponsive to Sinemet and she had autonomic dysfunction suggestive of Shy-Drager syndrome. It was recommended that she liberalize dietary salt use and lie with head of the bed elevate at 20-30 degrees at night. Indomethacin was suggested to improve BP in future."
378,Neurology,"CC: Weakness.HX: This 30 y/o RHM was in good health until 7/93, when he began experiencing RUE weakness and neck pain. He was initially treated by a chiropractor and, after an unspecified length of time, developed atrophy and contractures of his right hand. He then went to a local neurosurgeon and a cervical spine CT scan, 9/25/92, revealed an intramedullary lesion at C2-3 and an extramedullary lesion at C6-7. He underwent a C6-T1 laminectomy with exploration and decompression of the spinal cord. His clinical condition improved over a 3 month post-operative period, and then progressively worsened. He developed left sided paresthesia and upper extremity weakness (right worse than left). He then developed ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hyperreflexia. On 8/31/93, MRI C-spine showed diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa. On 9/1/93, he underwent suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy which was consistent with hemangioblastoma. His symptoms stabilized and he underwent 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to his brain and 3600 cGy in 20 fractions to his cervical and thoracic spinal cord from 9/93 through 1/19/94.He was evaluated in the NeuroOncology clinic on 10/26/95 for consideration of chemotherapy.

By 11/14/95, he required NGT feeding due to dysphagia and aspiration risk confirmed on cookie swallow studies.MRI Brain, 2/19/96, revealed several lesions (hemangioblastoma) in the cerebellum and brain stem. There were postoperative changes and a cyst in the medulla.On 10/25/96, he presented with a 1.5 week h/o numbness in BLE from the mid- thighs to his toes, and worsening BLE weakness. He developed decubitus ulcers on his buttocks. He also had had intermittent urinary retention for month, chronic SOB and dysphagia. He had been sitting all day long as he could not move well and had no daytime assistance. His exam findings were consistent with his complaints. He had had no episodes of diaphoresis, headache, or elevated blood pressures. An MRI of the C-T spine, 10/26/96, revealed a prominent cervicothoracic syrinx extending down to T10. There was evidence of prior cervical laminectomy of C6-T1 with expansion of the cord in the thecalsac at that region. Multiple intradural extra spinal nodular lesions (hyperintense on T2, isointense on T1, enhanced gadolinium) were seen in the cervical spine and cisterna magna.

391,Neurology,"EXAM: MRI of lumbar spine without contrast.HISTORY: A 24-year-old female with chronic back pain.TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial and sagittal images were acquired through the lumbar spine in varying degrees of fat and water weighting.FINDINGS: The visualized cord is normal in signal intensity and morphology with conus terminating in proper position. Visualized osseous structures are normal in marrow signal intensity and morphology without evidence for fracture/contusion, compression deformity, or marrow replacement process. There are no paraspinal masses.Disc heights, signal, and vertebral body heights are maintained throughout the lumbar spine.L5-S1: Central canal, neural foramina are patent.L4-L5: Central canal, neural foramina are patent.L3-L4: Central canal, neural foramen is patent.L2-L3: Central canal, neural foramina are patent.L1-L2: Central canal, neural foramina are patent.The visualized abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. Incidental note has been made of multiple left-sided ovarian, probable physiologic follicular cysts.IMPRESSION: No acute disease in the lumbar spine."
392,Neurology,"INTERPRETATION: MRI of the cervical spine without contrast showed normal vertebral body height and alignment with normal cervical cord signal. At C4-C5, there were minimal uncovertebral osteophytes with mild associated right foraminal compromise. At C5-C6, there were minimal diffuse disc bulge and uncovertebral osteophytes with indentation of the anterior thecal sac, but no cord deformity or foraminal compromise. At C6-C7, there was a central disc herniation resulting in mild deformity of the anterior aspect of the cord with patent neuroforamina. MRI of the thoracic spine showed normal vertebral body height and alignment. There was evidence of disc generation, especially anteriorly at the T5-T6 level. There was no significant central canal or foraminal compromise. Thoracic cord normal in signal morphology. MRI of the lumbar spine showed normal vertebral body height and alignment. There is disc desiccation at L4-L5 and L5-S1 with no significant central canal or foraminal stenosis at L1-L2, L2-L3, and L3-L4. There was a right paracentral disc protrusion at L4-L5 narrowing of the right lateral recess. The transversing nerve root on the right was impinged at that level. The right foramen was mildly compromised. There was also a central disc protrusion seen at the L5-S1 level resulting in indentation of the anterior thecal sac and minimal bilateral foraminal compromise.IMPRESSION: Overall impression was mild degenerative changes present in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine without high-grade central canal or foraminal narrowing. There was narrowing of the right lateral recess at L4-L5 level and associated impingement of the transversing nerve root at that level by a disc protrusion. This was also seen on a prior study."
393,Neurology,"CC: Progressive lower extremity weakness.HX: This 54 y/o RHF presented on 7/3/93 with a 2 month history of lower extremity weakness. She was admitted to a local hospital on 5/3/93 for a 3 day h/o of progressive BLE weakness associated with incontinence and BLE numbness. There was little symptom of upper extremity weakness at that time, according to the patient. Her evaluation was notable for a bilateral L1 sensory level and 4/4 strength in BLE. A T-L-S Spine MRI revealed a T4-6 lipomatosis with anterior displacement of the cord without cord compression. CSF analysis yielded: opening pressure of 14cm H20, protein 88, glucose 78, 3 lymphocytes and 160 RBC, no oligoclonal bands or elevated IgG index, and negative cytology. Bone marrow biopsy was negative. B12, Folate, and Ferritin levels were normal. CRP 5.2 (elevated). ANA was positive at 1:5,120 in speckled pattern. Her hospital course was complicated by deep venous thrombosis, which recurred after heparin was stopped to do the bone marrow biopsy. She was subsequently placed on Coumadin. EMG/NCV testing revealed "" lumbosacral polyradiculopathy with axonal degeneration and nerve conduction block."" She was diagnosed with atypical Guillain-Barre vs. polyradiculopathy and received a single course of Decadron; and no plasmapheresis or IV IgG. She was discharged home o 6/8/93.She subsequently did not improve and after awaking from a nap on her couch the day of presentation, 7/3/93, she found she was paralyzed from the waist down. There was associated mild upper lumbar back pain without radiation. She had had no bowel movement or urination since that time. She had no recent trauma, fever, chills, changes in vision, dysphagia or upper extremity deficit.MEDS: Coumadin 7.5mg qd, Zoloft 50mg qd, Lithium 300mg bid.PMH: 1) Bi-polar Affective Disorder, dx 1979 2) C-section.FHX: Unremarkable.SHX: Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use.EXAM: BP118/64, HR103, RR18, Afebrile.MS: A&O to person, place, time.

PT and PTT were normal. ABCG 7.46/25/79/96% O2Sat. UA notable for 1+ proteinuria. EKG normal.MRI L-spine, 7/3/93, revealed an area of abnormally increased T2 signal extending from T12 through L5. This area causes anterior displacement of the spinal cord and nerve roots. The cauda equina are pushed up against the posterior L1 vertebral body. There bilaterally pulmonary effusions. There is also abnormally increased T2 signal in the center of the spinal cord extending from the mid thoracic level through the conus. In addition, the Fila Terminale appear thickened. There is increased signal in the T3 vertebral body suggestion a hemangioma. The findings were felt consistent with a large epidural lipoma displacing the spinal cord anteriorly. there also appeared spinal cord swelling and increased signal within the spinal cord which suggests an intramedullary process.CSF analysis revealed: protein 1,342, glucose 43, RBC 4,900, WBC 9. C3 and C$ complement levels were 94 and 18 respectively (normal) Anticardiolipin antibodies were negative. Serum Beta-2 microglobulin was elevated at 2.4 and 3.7 in the CSF and Serum, respectively. It was felt the patient had either a transverse myelitis associated with SLE vs. partial cord infarction related to lupus vasculopathy or hypercoagulable state. She was place on IV Decadron. Rheumatology felt that a diagnosis of SLE was likely. Pulmonary effusion analysis was consistent with an exudate. She was treated with plasma exchange and place on Cytoxan.On 7/22/93 she developed fever with associated proptosis and sudden loss of vision, OD. MRI Brain, 7/22/93, revealed a 5mm thick area of intermediate signal adjacent to the posterior aspect of the right globe, possibly representing hematoma. Ophthalmology felt she had a central retinal vein occlusion; and it was surgically decompressed.She was placed on prednisone on 8/11/93 and Cytoxan was started on 8/16/93. She developed a headache with meningismus on 8/20/93. CSF analysis revealed: protein 1,002, glucose2, WBC 8,925 (majority were neutrophils). Sinus CT scan negative. She was placed on IV Antibiotics for presumed bacterial meningitis. Cultures were subsequently negative. She spontaneously recovered. 8/25/93, cisternal tap CSF analysis revealed: protein 126, glucose 35, WBC 144 (neutrophils), RBC 95, Cultures negative, cytology negative. MRI Brain scan revealed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement in both brain and spinal canal.DSDNA negative. She developed leukopenia in 9/93, and she was switched from Cytoxan to Imuran. Her LFT's rose and the Imuran was stopped and she was placed back on prednisone.She went on to have numerous deep venous thrombosis while on Coumadin. This required numerous hospital admissions for heparinization. Anticardiolipin antibodies and Protein C and S testing was negative."
394,Neurology,"CC: Paraplegia.HX: This 32 y/o RHF had been performing missionary work in Jos, Nigeria for several years and delivered her 4th child by vaginal delivery on 4/10/97. The delivery was induced with Pitocin, but was otherwise uncomplicated. For the first 4 days post-partum she noted clear liquid diarrhea without blood and minor abdominal discomfort. This spontaneous resolved without medical treatment. The second week post-partum she had 4-5 days of sinusitis, purulent nasal discharge and facial pain. She was otherwise well until 5/4/97 when stationed in a more rural area of Nigeria, she noted a dull ache in both knees (lateral to the patellae) and proximal tibia, bilaterally. The pain was not relieved by massage and seemed more bothersome when seated or supine. She had no sensory loss at the time.On 5/6/97, she awakened to pain radiating down her knees to her anterior tibia. Over the next few hours the pain radiated circumferentially around both calves, and involved the soles of her feet and posterior BLE to her buttocks. Rising from bed became a laborious task and she required assistance to walk to the bathroom. Ibuprofen provided minimal analgesia. By evening the sole of one foot was numb.She awoke the next morning, 5/9/97, with ""pins & needles"" sensation in BLE up to her buttocks. She was given Darvocet for analgesia and took an airplane back to the larger city she was based in. During the one hour flight her BLE weakness progressed to a non-weight bearing state (i.e. she could not stand). Local evaluation revealed 3/3 proximal and 4/4 distal BLE weakness. She had a sensory level to her waist on PP and LT testing. She also had mild lumbar back pain. Local laboratory evaluation: WBC 12.7, ESR 10. She was presumed to have Guillain-Barre syndrome and was placed on Solu-Cortef 1000mg qd and Sandimmune IV IgG 12.0 g.On 5/10/97, she was airlifted to Geneva, Switzerland. Upon arrival there she had total anesthesia from the feet up to the inguinal region, bilaterally. There was flaccid areflexic paralysis of BLE and she was unable to void or defecate. Straight catheterization of the bladder revealed a residual volume of 1000cc. On 5/12/ CSF analysis revealed: Protein 1.5g/l, Glucose 2.2mmol/l, WBC 92 (O PMNS, 100% Lymphocytes), RBC 70, Clear CSF, bacterial-fungal-AFB-cultures were negative. Broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol 1g IV qd were started. MRI T-L-spine, 5/12/97 revealed an intradural T12-L1 lesion that enhanced minimally with gadolinium and was associated with spinal cord edema in the affected area. MRI Brain, 5/12/97, was unremarkable and showed no evidence of demyelinating disease. HIV, HTLV-1, HSV, Lyme, EBV, Malaria and CMV serological titers were negative. On 5/15/97 the Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT serological titer returned positive at 1:320 (normal<1:80). 5/12/97 CSF Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT and ELISA were negative. She was then given a one day course of Praziquantel 3.6g total in 3 doses; and started on Prednisone 60 mg po qd; the broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol were discontinued.On 5/22/97, a rectal biopsy was performed to evaluate parasite eradication. The result came back positive for ova and granulomata after she had left for UIHC. The organism was not speciated. 5/22/97 CSF schistosomiasis ELISA and IFAT titers were positive at 1.09 and 1:160, respectively. These titers were not known when she initially arrived at UIHC.Following administration of Praziquantel, she regained some sensation in BLE but the paraplegia, and urinary retention remained.MEDS: On 5/24/97 UIHC arrival: Prednisone 60mg qd, Zantac 50 IV qd, Propulsid 20mg tid, Enoxaparin 20mg qd.PMH: 1)G4P4.FHX: unremarkable.SHX: Missionary.

This appeared to be intradural. There was mild enhancement. There was more enhancement along the distal cord surface and cauda equina. The distal cord had sign of diffuse edema. She underwent exploratory and decompressive laminectomy on 5/27/97, and was retreated with a one day course of Praziquantel 40mg/kg/day. Praziquantel is reportedly only 80% effective at parasite eradication.She continued to reside on the Neurology/Neurosurgical service on 5/31/97 and remained paraplegic."
395,Neurology,"CC: BLE weakness.HX: This 82y/o RHM was referred to the Neurology service by the Neurosurgery service for evaluation of acute onset paraplegia. He was in his usual state of health until 5:30PM on 4/6/95, when he developed sudden ""pressure-like"" epigastric discomfort associated with bilateral lower extremity weakness, SOB, lightheadedness and diaphoresis. He knelt down to the floor and ""went to sleep."" The Emergency Medical Service was alert and arrived within minutes, at which time he was easily aroused though unable to move or feel his lower extremities. No associated upper extremity or bulbar dysfunction was noted. He was taken to a local hospital where an INR was found to be 9.1. He was given vitamin K 15mg, and transferred to UIHC to rule out spinal epidural hemorrhage. An MRI scan of the T-spine was obtained and the preliminary reading was ""normal.""

He recovered some lower extremity strength following surgery. Pathological analysis of the tumor was consistent with adenocarcinoma. His primary tumor was not located despite chest-abdominal-pelvic CT scans, and a GI and GU workup which included cystoscopy and endoscopy. He received 3000cGy of XRT and died 5 months after presentation."
398,Neurology,"CC: Stable expressive aphasia and decreased vision.HX: This 72y/o woman was diagnosed with a left sphenoid wing meningioma on 6/3/80. She was 59 years old at the time and presented with a 6 month history of increasing irritability and left occipital-nuchal headaches. One month prior to that presentation she developed leftward head turning, and 3 days prior to presentation had an episode of severe dysphasia. A HCT (done locally) revealed a homogenously enhancing lesion of the left sphenoid wing. Skull X-rays showed deviation of the pineal to the right. She was transferred to UIHC and was noted to have a normal neurologic exam (per Neurosurgery note). Angiography demonstrated a highly vascular left temporal/sphenoid wing tumor. She under went left temporal craniotomy and ""complete resection"" of the tumor which on pathologic analysis was consistent with a meningioma.The left sphenoid wing meningioma recurred and was excised 9/25/84. There was regrowth of this tumor seen on HCT, 1985. A 6/88 HCT revealed the left sphenoid meningioma and a new left tentorial meningioma. HCT in 1989 revealed left temporal/sphenoid, left tentorial, and new left frontal lesions. On 2/14/91 she presented with increasing lethargy and difficulty concentrating. A 2/14/91, HCT revealed increased size and surrounding edema of the left frontal meningioma. The left frontal and temporal meningiomas were excised on 2/25/91. These tumors all recurred and a left parietal lesion developed. She underwent resection of the left frontal meningioma on 11/21/91 due to right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness partially resolved and though the speech improved following resection it did not return to normal. In May 1992 she experienced 3 tonic-clonic type seizures, all of which began with a Jacksonian march up the RLE then RUE before generalizing. Her Phenobarbital prophylaxis which she had been taking since her 1980 surgery was increased. On 12/7/92, she underwent a left fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital craniotomy and excision of five meningiomas. Postoperatively she developed worsened right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness and aphasia improved by 3/93, but never returned to normal."
399,Neurology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms. I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems. He first mentioned that he has neck pain. He states that he has had this for at least 15 years. It is worse with movement. It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years. It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality. He also endorses a history of gait instability. This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening. He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and ""walks like a duck."" He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half.He also describes that he has numbness in his feet. When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes. Left is slightly more affected than the right. He denies any tingling or paresthesias. He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands. He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands. This has also been occurring for the past one to two years. He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him. He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands. He does have a history of chronic low back pain.At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome. He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking. When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion. He basically lays in bed all day everyday. I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression. He is unsure if this is optimally treated. As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities. He does not think that he is necessarily sad. His appetite is good. He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression.When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past. I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago. He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia.When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago. He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes. He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation. He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago. He reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has had diabetes for five years.

Spondylosis of C6-C7 causing mild bilateral neuroforamining and left paracentral disc herniation causing borderline cord compression.Thoracic MRI spine without contrast: Minor degenerative changes without stenosis.I do not have the MRI of the lumbar spine available to review.LABORATORY DATA: 10/07/08: Vitamin B1 210 (87-280), vitamin B6 6, ESR 6, AST 25, ALT 17, vitamin B12 905, CPK 226 (0-200), T4 0.85, TSH 3.94, magnesium 1.7, RPR nonreactive, CRP 4, Lyme antibody negative, SPEP abnormal (serum protein electrophoresis), but no paraprotein by manifestation, hemoglobin A1c 6.0, aldolase 3.9 and homocystine 9.0.ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 63-year-old gentleman with multiple neurologic and nonneurologic symptoms including numbness, gait instability, decreased dexterity of his arms and general fatigue. His neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a length-dependent fashion in his feet and legs with scant fasciculations in his calves. He has fairly normal or very mild increased reflexes including notably the presence of normal ankle jerks.I think that the etiology of his symptoms is multifactorial. He probably does have a mild peripheral neuropathy, but the sparing of ankle jerks suggested either the neuropathy is mild or that there is a superimposed myelopathic process such as a cervical or lumbosacral myelopathy. He really is most concerned about the fatigue and I think it is possible due to suboptimally treated depression and suboptimally treated sleep apnea. Whether he has another underlying muscular disorder such as a primary myopathy remains to be seen.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. I scheduled him for repeat EMG and nerve conduction studies to evaluate for evidence of neuropathy or myopathy.2. I will review his films at our spine conference tomorrow although I am confident in Dr. Z's opinion that there is no surgical indication.3. I gave him a prescription for physical therapy to help with gait imbalance training as well as treatment for his neck pain.4. I believe that he needs to undergo psychotherapy for his depression. It may also be worthwhile to adjust his medications, but I will defer to his primary care physician for managing this or for referring him to a therapist. The patient is very open about proceeding with this suggestion.5. He does need to have his sleep apnea better controlled. He states that he is not compliant because the face mask that he uses does not fit him well. This should also be addressed.6. I also am checking another CPK to see if there is any elevation."
400,Neurology,"DIAGNOSES:1. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.2. Recent generalized tonic-clonic seizure.MEDICATIONS:1. Lamictal 250 mg b.i.d.2. Depo-Provera.INTERIM HISTORY: The patient returns for followup. Since last consultation she has tolerated Lamictal well, but she has had a recurrence of her myoclonic jerking. She has not had a generalized seizure. She is very concerned that this will occur. Most of the myoclonus is in the mornings. Recent EEG did show polyspike and slow wave complexes bilaterally, more prominent on the left. She states that she has been very compliant with the medications and is getting a good amount of sleep. She continues to drive.Social history and review of systems are discussed above and documented on the chart.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs are normal. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. There is no nystagmus. Visual fields are full. Demeanor is normal. Facial sensation and symmetry is normal. No myoclonic jerks noted during this examination. No myoclonic jerks provoked by tapping on her upper extremity muscles. Negative orbit. Deep tendon reflexes are 2 and symmetric. Gait is normal. Tandem gait is normal. Romberg negative.IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Recurrence of early morning myoclonus despite high levels of Lamictal. She is tolerating the medication well and has not had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. She is concerned that this is a precursor for another generalized seizure. She states that she is compliant with her medications and has had a normal sleep-wake cycle.Looking back through her notes, she initially responded very well to Keppra, but did have a breakthrough seizure on Keppra. This was thought secondary to severe insomnia when her baby was very young. Because she tolerated the medication well and it was at least partially affective, I have recommended adding Keppra 500 mg b.i.d. Side effect profile of this medication was discussed with the patient.I will see in followup in three months."
401,Neurology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Neck and lower back pain.VEHICULAR TRAUMA HISTORY: Date of incident: 1/15/2001. The patient was the driver of a small sports utility vehicle and was wearing a seatbelt. The patient�s vehicle was proceeding through an intersection and was struck by another vehicle from the left side and forced off the road into a utility pole. The other vehicle had reportedly been driven by a drunk driver and ran a traffic signal. Estimated impact speed was 80 m.p.h. The driver of the other vehicle was reportedly cited by police. The patient was transiently unconscious and came to the scene. There was immediate onset of headaches, neck and lower back pain. The patient was able to exit the vehicle and was subsequently transported by Rescue Squad to St. Thomas Memorial Hospital, evaluated in the emergency room and released.NECK AND LOWER BACK PAIN HISTORY: The patient relates the persistence of pain since the motor vehicle accident. Symptoms began immediately following the MVA. Because of persistent symptoms, the patient subsequently sought chiropractic treatment. Neck pain is described as severe. Neck pain remains localized and is non-radiating. There are no associated paresthesias. Back pain originates in the lumbar region and radiates down both lower extremities. Back pain is characterized as worse than the neck pain. There are no associated paresthesias. Stiffness is provoked by attempts at strenuous activity. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping, unable to find a comfortable position. The patient denies any previous back problems. During the day, the pain is exacerbated by strenuous activities. Pain may be eased by resting or recumbency and sitting. The patients activity level has been significantly restricted. Some improvement has been noted with chiropractic treatment. Since the onset of the problem, the pain has continued at more less the same level. The patient reports that, prior to the present problem described above, there had been no episodes of neck or lower back pain.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Negative.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Hysterectomy (3/20/99).PERSONAL/SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is right-handed. She does not smoke and does not drink alcohol.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:ROS Ears Nose and Throat: Patient has no problems related to the ears, nose or throat.ROS Respiratory: Patient denies any respiratory complaints, such as cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing, hemoptysis, etc.ROS Cardiovascular: Chest pain in the retrosternal area, occasional anginal pain that patient describes as a sensation of tightness. Pain radiates to the left shoulder. Patient denies any palpitation, syncope, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea.ROS Gastrointestinal: Patient denies any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysphagia or any altered bowel movements.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Darvocet N100. Flexeril. Allergies: There are no known drug allergies.EXAMINATION: The patient is well-developed, well-nourished, black female. The patient was pleasant and cooperative.Mental Status: Evaluation unremarkable. Affect was appropriate.Neck: The cervical lordosis was flattened, with the head held in flexion. There was no appreciable cervical muscle spasm. There was moderate tenderness over both supraclavicular fossae. Cervical range of motion was slightly restricted in all planes. Spurlings maneuver was negative bilaterally. There were no foraminal compression signs.Back: The lumbar lordosis was well-maintained. There was no appreciable lumbar paravertebral muscle spasm. There was focal tenderness over both sciatic notches and the left popliteal fossa. Lumbar range of motion was full in all planes. Straight leg raising was negative to 90 degrees bilaterally.Cranial Nerves: Evaluation was unremarkable. Fundi were benign OU.Motor: Individual muscle and group-function testing showed no appreciable deficit or asymmetry of performance in either upper or lower extremities.Reflexes: DTRs were normoactive and symmetrical. There were no pathologic responses.Sensory: Patchy sensory deficits were appreciated over the right upper extremity. There was no dermatomal sensory deficit.RADIOLOGY (CX SPINE): Films of the relevant radiologic studies of the cervical spine were reviewed: Cervical MRI scan (1/15/2001). There is loss of cervical lordosis and straightening of the cervical spine. There is no apparent intervertebral disc protrusion.RADIOLOGY (TLS SPINE): Films of the relevant lumbar neuroradiologic procedures were reviewed: Lumbar MRI scan (1/15/2001). The study is unremarkable. The lumbar lordosis is well-maintained.ASSESSMENT: S/P vehicular trauma 1/15/2001. Low Back syndrome (724.2). Cervicalgia (723.1).COMMENTS: The clinical picture and neurodiagnostic studies indicate that the patient has sustained significant injuries as a direct result of vehicular trauma. There is no indication for surgical intervention. Continued chiropractic treatment should be of benefit, with an emphasis on soft tissue techniques and mobilization. Physiatry consultation may be considered.TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS: The patient was advised to gradually and progressively increase activity levels, as tolerated, while continuing to avoid anything unduly strenuous."
402,Neurology,"In July 2003 the patient had an episode of lightheaded or near syncope. She was taken to Hospital and admitted for 24 hours. Workup was negative. Soon after that, she had another episode of weakness and was taken to Valley Presbyterian Hospital emergency room and admitted. She was diagnosed as having dehydration and was treated with intravenous fluids and then was discharged after about one day.Subsequently, the patient developed a moderately severe depression. She was tried on various medications, which caused sweating, nightmares and perhaps other side effects. She was finally put on Effexor 25 mg two tablets h.s. and trazodone 100 mg h.s., and has done fairly well, although she still has significant depression.Her daughter brought her in today to be sure that she does not have dementia. There is no history of memory loss. There is no history of focal neurologic symptoms or significant headaches.The patient's complaints, according to the daughter, include not wanted to go out in public, shamed regarding her appearance (25-pound weight loss over the past year), eating poorly, not doing things unless asked, hiding food to prevent having to eat it, nervousness, and not taking a shower. She has no focal neurologic deficits. She does complain of constipation. She has severe sleep maintenance insomnia and often sleeps only 2 hours before awakening frequently for the rest of the night.The patient was apparently visiting her daughter in northern California in December 2003. She was taken to her daughter's primary care physician. She underwent vitamin B12 level, RPR, T4 and TSH, all of which were normal.On 05/15/04, the patient underwent MRI scan of the brain. I reviewed the scan in the office today. This shows moderate cortical and central atrophy and also shows mild-to-moderate deep white matter ischemic changes.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has generally been in reasonably good physical health. She did have a ""nervous breakdown"" in 1975 after the death of her husband. She was hospitalized for several weeks and was treated with ECT. This occurred while she was living in Korea.She does not smoke or drink alcoholic beverages. She has had no prior surgeries. There is a past history of hypertension, but this is no longer present.FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for dementia. Her mother died of a stroke at the age of 62.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Vital Signs: Blood pressure 128/80, pulse 84, temperature 97.4 F, and weight 105 lbs (dressed).General: Well-developed, well-nourished Korean female in no acute distress.Head: Normocephalic, without evidence of trauma or bruits.Neck: Supple, with full range of motion. No spasm or tenderness. Carotid pulsations are of normal volume and contour bilaterally without bruits. No thyromegaly or adenopathy.Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, edema, or deformity. Range of motion full throughout.NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:Mental Status: The patient is awake, alert and oriented to time, place, and person and generally appropriate. She exhibits mild psychomotor retardation and has a flat or depressed affect. She knows the current president of Korea and the current president of the United States. She can recall 3 out of 3 objects after 5 minutes. Calculations are performed fairly well with occasional errors. There is no right-left confusion, finger agnosia, dysnomia or aphasia.Cranial Nerves:II: Visual fields full to confrontation. Fundi benign.III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements full throughout, without nystagmus. No ptosis. Pupils equal, round and react briskly to light and accommodation.V: Normal sensation to light touch and pinprick bilaterally. Corneal reflexes equal bilaterally. Motor function normal.VII: No facial asymmetry.VIII: Hears finger rub bilaterally. Weber and Rinne tests normal.IX & X: Palate elevates symmetrically bilaterally with phonation. Gag reflex equal bilaterally.XI: Sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius normal tone, bulk and strength bilaterally.XII: Tongue protrudes in the midline without atrophy or fasciculations. Rapid alternating movements normal. No dysarthria.Motor: Tone, bulk, and strength are normal throughout. No drift of outstretched upper extremities. No tremors, fasciculations or abnormal involuntary movements.Reflexes (right/left): Biceps 2/2, triceps 1/1, brachioradialis 1/1, knee jerk 1/1 and ankle jerk 1/1. Plantar responses are flexor bilaterally. No snout, glabellar or palmomental reflex.Coordination: No dysmetria or dysdiadochokinesia in upper or lower extremities.Gait: Intact, including tandem gait and heel and toe walking.Station: Romberg normal.Sensation: Intact to pinprick, light touch, vibration and position sense throughout. Normal stereognosis, graphesthesia, and double simultaneous stimulation.DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:1. Depression, partially treated.2. Possible early dementia.CASE DISCUSSION: Thank you once again Dr. X for allowing me to participate in the care of this very nice lady. She clearly has residual depression despite the above-mentioned treatment protocol.In order to assess the possibility of an occult cognitive impairment, I recommended neuropsychological testing along with EEG and P-300 long latency auditory evoked response study. I would also like to obtain a DHEA and DHEA sulfate level, as decreased amounts of these hormones may result in cognitive dysfunction and depression.I have asked the patient to return for follow up after completion of the studies.She should be considered for a retrial of Remeron, as this generally helps to improve appetite and sleep in these elderly patients. The normal dosage for elderly small patients such as this is 15 mg h.s."
403,Neurology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness. He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem. To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg. He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe. Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks. He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness. He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed. He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year. This dissipated about two months ago. He does not think that his left leg is weak. He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence. There is no radicular pain. He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago.He first sought medical attention for this problem in October. He then saw you a couple of months later. He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies. Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant. He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal.In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia. He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me. He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it. Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped. He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s. I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this. More recently, he has been started taking Zetia. He does not have any proximal weakness. He denies any myalgias.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has coronary artery disease and has received five stents. He has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He states that he was diagnosed with diabetes based on the results of an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test. He believes that his glucose shot up to over 300 with this testing. He does not take any medications for this and his blood glucoses are generally normal when he checks it. He has had plastic surgery on his face from an orbital injury. He also had an ear graft when he developed an ear infection during his honeymoon.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: He takes amlodipine, Diovan, Zetia, hydrochlorothiazide, Lovaza (fish oil), Niaspan, aspirin, and Chantix. ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives with his wife. He works at Shepherd Pratt doing network engineering. He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and is working on quitting. He drinks four alcoholic beverages per night. Prior to that, he drank significantly more. He denies illicit drug use. He was athletic growing up.FAMILY HISTORY: His mother died of complications from heart disease. His father died of heart disease in his 40s. He has two living brothers. One of them he does not speak too much with and does not know about his medical history. The other is apparently healthy. He has one healthy child. His maternal uncles apparently had polio. When I asked him to tell me further details about this, he states that one of them had to wear crutches due to severe leg deformans and then the other had leg deformities in only one leg. He is fairly certain that they had polio. He is unaware of any other family members with neurological conditions.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He has occasional tinnitus. He has difficulty sleeping. Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above. This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Vital Signs: BP 116/72 Heart rate 68 Respiratory rate 18 Weight 243 pounds Temperature 98.2 Pain 0/10General Appearance: He is well appearing, in no acute distress.Cardiovascular: He has a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. There are no carotid bruits.Chest: His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Skin: There are no rashes or lesions. Musculoskeletal: He has no joint deformities or scoliosis.NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:Mental Status: His speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia. He is alert and oriented to name, place, and date. Attention, concentration, registration, recall, and fund of knowledge are intact.Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Optic discs are normal. Visual fields are full. Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus. Facial sensation is normal. There is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness. Hearing is grossly intact. Shoulder shrug is full.Motor: He has mild thinning of his right hamstrings, calf muscles, and quadriceps on the right. There are scant fasciculations in both calves' muscles. The tone is normal. There is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia. Manual muscle testing reveals MRC grade 5/5 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper extremities. In his lower extremities, his strength is as follows: hip flexion 5/5 bilaterally, hip extension 5/5 bilaterally, ankle dorsiflexion 5/5 on the left and 4/5 on the right, ankle inversion 5/5 bilaterally, ankle eversion 4/5 on the right and 5/5 on the left, toe flexion 4/5 on the right and 5/5 on the left.Sensory: He has diminished vibratory sensation at both toes. Joint position sense is intact. Romberg is absent. Light touch, pinprick, and temperature are intact. He has a Tinel's sign at the right fibular head and bilateral elbows.Coordination: This is intact by finger-nose-finger and heel-to-shin testing.Deep Tendon Reflexes: They are 1+ at the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis. Patellar jerks are 2+. Ankle jerks are absent. Plantar reflexes are flexor.Gait and Stance: He has a very mild steppage gait due to the mild right dorsiflexion weakness. He has difficulty walking on his heels. He also cannot walk on his toes and cannot do toe raises on the left.ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman with a six-month history of mild right leg weakness. He does not complain of a lot of sensory symptoms. His neurological examination is notable for dorsiflexion and plantar flexion weakness although he has eversion and not inversion weakness on the right. He also has mild atrophy of the leg without any obvious sensory deficits.I think he seemingly has a peroneal neuropathy with a superimposed lumbosacral radiculopathy. Alternative diagnoses include a more systemic neuropathy and certainly his mild diabetes and increased alcohol intake may be contributing to his problems. I do think that his history that he sits in his chair with his leg leaning against the desk on the right is probably relevant and probably causing the worsening of the peroneal neuropathy.PLAN:1. I scheduled him to return for an EMG and nerve conduction studies.2. If you kindly send me all of his records including specifically the labs that have been obtained through his primary care physician or through you, I would appreciate it.3. Depending on the results of the study, I may recommend that he undergo a CT myelogram to better define his anatomy in his back although again it is unclear if this is a sole etiology for his problems."
404,Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: The patient is an 11-month-old with a diagnosis of stage 2 neuroblastoma here for ongoing management of his disease and the visit is supervised by Dr. X.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 11-month-old with neuroblastoma, which initially presented on the left when he was 6 weeks old and was completely resected. It was felt to be stage 2. It was not N-Myc amplified and had favorable Shimada histology. In followup, he was found to have a second primary in his right adrenal gland, which was biopsied and also consistent with neuroblastoma with favorable Shimada histology. He is now being treated with chemotherapy per protocol P9641 and not on study. He last received chemotherapy on 05/21/07, with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin. He received G-CSF daily after his chemotherapy due to neutropenia that delayed his second cycle. In the interval since he was last seen, his mother reports that he had a couple of days of nasal congestion, but it is now improving. He is not acted ill or had any fevers. He has had somewhat diminished appetite, but it seems to be improving now. He is peeing and pooping normally and has not had any diarrhea. He did not have any appreciated nausea or vomiting. He has been restarted on fluconazole due to having redeveloped thrush recently.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The following systems reviewed and negative per pathology except as noted above. Eyes, ears, throat, cardiovascular, GI, genitourinary, musculoskeletal skin, and neurologic. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Reviewed as above and otherwise unchanged.FAMILY HISTORY: Reviewed and unchanged.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient's parents continued to undergo a separation and divorce. The patient spends time with his father and his family during the first part of the week and with his mother during the second part of the week.MEDICATIONS: 1. Bactrim 32 mg by mouth twice a day on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.2. G-CSF 50 mcg subcutaneously given daily in his thighs alternating with each dose.3. Fluconazole 37.5 mg daily.4. Zofran 1.5 mg every 6 hours as needed for nausea.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.FINDINGS: A detailed physical exam revealed a very active and intractable, well-nourished 11-month-old male with weight 10.5 kilos and height 76.8 cm. Vital Signs: Temperature is 35.3 degrees Celsius, pulse is 121 beats per minute, respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, blood pressure 135/74 mmHg. Eyes: Conjunctivae are clear, nonicteric. Pupils are equally round and reactive to light. Extraocular muscle movements appear intact with no strabismus. Ears: TMs are clear bilaterally. Oral Mucosa: No thrush is appreciated. No mucosal ulcerations or erythema. Chest: Port-a-Cath is nonerythematous and nontender to VP access port. Respiratory: Good aeration, clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular: Regular rate, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs appreciated. Abdomen is soft, nontender, and no organomegaly, unable to appreciate a right-sided abdominal mass or any other masses. Skin: No rashes. Neurologic: The patient walks without assistance, frequently falls on his bottom.LABORATORY STUDIES: CBC and comprehensive metabolic panel were obtained and they are significant for AST 51, white blood cell count 11,440, hemoglobin 10.9, and platelets 202,000 with ANC 2974. Medical tests none. Radiologic studies are none.ASSESSMENT: This patient's disease is life threatening, currently causing moderately severe side effects.PROBLEMS DIAGNOSES: 1. Neuroblastoma of the right adrenal gland with favorable Shimada histology.2. History of stage 2 left adrenal neuroblastoma, status post gross total resection.3. Immunosuppression.4. Mucosal candidiasis.5. Resolving neutropenia.PROCEDURES AND IMMUNIZATIONS: None.PLANS: 1. Neuroblastoma. The patient will return to the Pediatric Oncology Clinic on 06/13/07 to 06/15/07 for his third cycle of chemotherapy. I will plan for restaging with CT of the abdomen prior to the cycle.2. Immunosuppression. The patient will continue on his Bactrim twice a day on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Additionally, we will tentatively plan to have him continue fluconazole since this is his second episode of thrush.3. Mucosal candidiasis. We will continue fluconazole for thrush. I am pleased that the clinical evidence of disease appears to have resolved. For resolving neutropenia, I advised Gregory's mother about it is okay to discontinue the G-CSF at this time. We will plan for him to resume G-CSF after his next chemotherapy and prescription has been sent to the patient's pharmacy.PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY ATTENDING: I have reviewed the history of the patient. This is an 11-month-old with neuroblastoma who received chemotherapy with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin on 05/21/07 for cycle 2 of POG-9641 due to his prior history of neutropenia, he has been on G-CSF. His ANC is nicely recovered. He will have a restaging CT prior to his next cycle of chemotherapy and then return for cycle 3 chemotherapy on 06/13/07 to 06/15/07. He continues on fluconazole for recent history of thrush. Plans are otherwise documented above."
405,Neurology,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Neurologic consultation was requested by Dr. X to evaluate her seizure medication and lethargy.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is well known to me. She has symptomatic partial epilepsy secondary to a static encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, and shunted hydrocephalus related to prematurity. She also has a history of factor V Leiden deficiency. She was last seen at neurology clinic on 11/16/2007. At that time, instructions were given to mom to maximize her Trileptal dose if seizures continue. She did well on 2 mL twice a day without any sedation. This past Friday, she had a 25-minute seizure reportedly. This consisted of eye deviation, unresponsiveness, and posturing. Diastat was used and which mom perceived was effective. Her Trileptal dose was increased to 3 mL b.i.d. yesterday.According to mom since her shunt revision on 12/18/2007, she has been sleepier than normal. She appeared to be stable until this past Monday about six days ago, she became more lethargic and had episodes of vomiting and low-grade fevers. According to mom, she had stopped vomiting since her hospitalization. Reportedly, she was given a medication in the emergency room. She still is lethargic, will not wake up spontaneously. When she does awaken however, she is appropriate, and interacts with them. She is able to eat well; however her overall p.o. intake has been diminished. She has also been less feisty as her usual sounds. She has been seizure free since her admission.LABORATORY DATA: Pertinent labs obtained here showed the following: CRP is less than 0.3, CMP normal, and CBC within normal limits. CSF cultures so far is negative. Dr. Limon's note refers to a CSF, white blood cell count of 2, 1 RBC, glucose of 55, and protein of 64. There are no imaging studies in the computer. I believe that this may have been done at Kaweah Delta Hospital and reviewed by Dr. X, who indicated that there was no evidence of shunt malfunction or infection.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Trileptal 180 mg b.i.d., lorazepam 1 mg p.r.n., acetaminophen, and azithromycin.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: The patient was asleep, but easily aroused. There was a brief period of drowsiness, which she had some jerky limb movements, but not seizures. She eventually started crying and became agitated. She made attempts to sit by bending her neck forward. Fully awake, she sucks her bottle eagerly.HEENT: She was obviously visually impaired. Pupils were 3 mm, sluggishly reactive to light.EXTREMITIES: Bilateral lower extremity spasticity was noted. There was increased flexor tone in the right upper extremity. IV was noted on the left hand.ASSESSMENT: Seizure breakthrough due to intercurrent febrile illness. Her lethargy could be secondary to a viral illness with some component of medication effect since her Trileptal dose was increased yesterday and these are probable explanations if indeed shunt malfunction has been excluded.I concur with Dr. X's recommendations. I do not recommend any changes in Trileptal for now. I will be available while she remains hospitalized."
406,Neurology,"I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. ABC in neurologic consultation and follow-up on MM/DD/YYYY. Mr. ABC reports that he has had several issues in the family. One of them is that his grandmother passed. In addition, the family dog fell ill. This has led to distress. He reports better controlled pain. Mr. ABC reports, otherwise, intermittent adherence to Copaxone. He had in the past been on interferon, but did not tolerate the medication, because of side effects. His sleep/wake cycle remains very erratic.SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Reviewed. There are no changes, otherwise.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Fatigue, pain, difficulty with sleep, mood fluctuations, low stamina, mild urgency frequency and hesitancy, preponderance of lack of stamina, preponderance of pain particularly in the left shoulder.EXAMINATION: The patient is alert and oriented. Extraocular movements are full. The face is symmetric. The uvula is midline. Speech has normal prosody. Today there is much less guarding of the left shoulder. In the lower extremities, iliopsoas, quadriceps, femoris and tibialis anterior are full. The gait is narrow based and noncircumductive. Rapid alternating movements are slightly off bilaterally. The gait does not have significant slapping characteristics. Sensory examination is largely unremarkable. Heart, lungs, and abdomen are within normal limits.IMPRESSION: Mr. ABC is doing about the same. We discussed the issue of adherence to Copaxone. In order to facilitate this, I would like him to take Copaxone every other day, but on a regular rhythm. His wife continues to inject him. He has not been able to start himself on the injections.Greater than 50% of this 40-minute appointment was devoted to counseling."
407,Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: The patient is a 76-year-old man referred for neurological consultation by Dr. X. The patient is companied to clinic today by his wife and daughter. He provides a small portion of his history; however, his family provides virtually all of it.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: He has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory. When I asked him to provide me detail, he could not tell me much more than the fact that he has trouble with his walking and that he has trouble with his bladder. He is vaguely aware that he has trouble with his memory.According to his family, he has had difficulty with his gait for at least three or four years. At first, they thought it was weakness and because of he was on the ground (for example, gardening) he was not able to get up by himself. They did try stopping the statin that he was taking at that time, but because there was no improvement over two weeks, they resumed the statin. As time progressed, he developed more and more difficulty. He started to shuffle. He started using a cane about two and a half years ago and has used a walker with wheels in the front since July of 2006. At this point, he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out of the seat. He frequently tends to lean backwards or sideways when sitting. He frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out a car, always shuffles or scuffs his feet, always has trouble turning or changing direction, always has trouble with uneven surfaces or curbs, and always has to hold on to someone or something when walking. He has not fallen in the last month. He did fall earlier, but there seemed to be fewer opportunities for him to fall. His family has recently purchased a lightweight wheelchair to use if he is traveling long distances. He has no stairs in his home, however, his family indicates that he would not be able to take stairs. His handwriting has become smaller and shakier.In regard to the bladder, he states, ""I wet the bed."" In talking with his family, it seems as if he has no warning that he needs to empty his bladder. He was diagnosed with a small bladder tumor in 2005. This was treated by Dr. Y. Dr. X does not think that the bladder tumor has anything to do with the patient's urinary incontinence. The patient has worn a pad or undergarment for at least one to one and a half years. His wife states that they go through two or three of them per day. He has been placed on medications; however, they have not helped.He has no headaches or sensation of head fullness.In regard to the thinking and memory, at first he seemed forgetful and had trouble with dates. Now he seems less spontaneous and his family states he seems to have trouble expressing himself. His wife took over his medications about two years ago. She stopped his driving about three years ago. She discovered that his license had been expired for about a year and she was concerned enough at that time that she told him he could drive no more. Apparently, he did not object. At this point, he frequently has trouble with memory, orientation, and everyday problems solving at home. He needs coaching for his daily activities such as reminders to brush his teeth, put on his clothes, and so forth. He is a retired office machine repairman. He is currently up and active about 12 hours a day and sleeping or lying down about 12 hours per day.He has not had PT or OT and has not been treated with medications for Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease. He has been treated for the bladder. He has not had lumbar puncture.Past medical history and review of all 14 systems from the form they completed for this visit that I reviewed with them is negative with the exception that he has had hypertension since 1985, hypercholesterolemia since 1997, and diabetes since 1998. The bladder tumor was discovered in 2005 and was treated noninvasively. He has lost weight from about 200 pounds to 180 pounds over the last two or three years. He had a period of depression in 1999 and was on Prozac for a while, but this was then stopped. He used to drink a significant amount of alcohol. This was problematic enough that his wife was concerned. She states he stopped when she retired and she was at home all day.SOCIAL HISTORY: He quit smoking in 1968. His current weight is 183 pounds. His tallest height is 5 feet 10 inches.FAMILY HISTORY: His grandfather had arthritis. His father had Parkinson's disease. His mother had heart disease and a sister has diabetes.He does not have a Living Will and indicates he would wish his wife to make decisions for him if he could not make them for himself.REVIEW OF HYDROCEPHALUS RISK FACTORS: None.ALLERGIES: None.MEDICATIONS: Metformin 500 mg three times a day, Lipitor 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg per day, Uroxatral 10 mg per day, Detrol LA 4 mg per day, and aspirin 81 mg per day.PHYSICAL EXAM: On examination today, this is a pleasant 76-year-old man who is guided back from the clinic waiting area walking with his walker. He is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.Vital Signs: His weight is 180 pounds.Head: The head is normocephalic and atraumatic. The head circumference is 59 cm, which is the 75-90th percentile for an adult man whose height is 178 cm.Spine: The spine is straight and not tender. I can easily palpate the spinous processes. There is no scoliosis.Skin: No neurocutaneous stigmata.Cardiovascular Examination: No carotid or vertebral bruits.Mental Status: Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge. The Mini-Mental State Exam score was 17/30. He did not know the year, season, or day of the week nor did he know the building or specialty or the floor. There was a tendency for perseveration during the evaluation. He could not copy the diagram of intersecting pentagons.Cranial Nerve Exam: No evidence of papilledema. The pupillary light reflex is intact as are extraocular movements without nystagmus, facial expression and sensation, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement.Motor Exam: Normal bulk and strength, but the tone is marked by significant paratonia. There is no atrophy, fasciculations, or drift. There is tremulousness of the outstretched hands.Sensory Exam: Is difficult to interpret. Either he does not understand the test or he is mostly guessing.Cerebellar Exam: Is intact for finger-to-nose, heel-to-knee, and rapid alternating movement tests. There is no dysarthria.Reflexes: Trace in the arms, 2+ at the knees, and 0 at the ankles. It is not certain whether there is a Babinski sign or simply withdrawal.Gait: Assessed using the Tinetti assessment tool that shows a balance score of 7-10/16 and a gait score of 2-5/12 for a total score of 9-15/28, which is significantly impaired.REVIEW OF X-RAYS: I personally reviewed the MRI scan of the brain from December 11, 2007 at Advanced Radiology. It shows the ventricles are enlarged with a frontal horn span of 5.0 cm. The 3rd ventricle contour is flat. The span is enlarged at 12 mm. The sylvian aqueduct is patent. There is a pulsation artifact. The corpus callosum is effaced. There are extensive T2 signal abnormalities that are confluent in the corona radiata. There are also scattered T2 abnormalities in the basal ganglia. There is a suggestion of hippocampal atrophy. There is also a suggestion of vermian atrophy.ASSESSMENT: The patient has a clinical syndrome that raises the question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus. His examination today is notable for moderate-to-severe dementia and moderate-to-severe gait impairment. His MRI scan raises the question of hydrocephalus, however, is also consistent with cerebral small vessel disease.PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:1. Possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).2. Probable cerebral small-vessel disease (290.40 & 438).3. Gait impairment (781.2).4. Urinary urgency and incontinence (788.33).5. Dementia.6. Hypertension.7. Hypercholesterolemia.8. Diabetes.PLAN: I had a long conversation with him and his family. I explained how the symptoms raise the question of hydrocephalus, but are not specific. I also explained how the appearance of the ventricles on the MRI scan raise the question of hydrocephalus, but are not specific for. I also described the evidence on the MRI scan of the long-term effects of his vascular risk factors and explained to his family that these can cause a clinical syndrome that is virtually identical to hydrocephalus. I explained that it is possible for patients to have both and the best way to determine whether he has hydrocephalus, and more specifically whether he would benefit from shunt surgery is to undertake a test with temporary removal of spinal fluid. I reviewed both our outpatient lumbar puncture approach and our inpatient spinal catheter protocol. I gave them a printed description of the inpatient spinal catheter protocol. His daughter tape-recorded our discussions, so that they can review this.We did review the specific risk of 2% to 3% chance of infection associated with the spinal catheter protocol. I told them that this is not an emergency and they can take the time to review the details and to contact our office if they have any questions, or if they would like to proceed with testing."
408,Neurology,"HISTORY: Neurologic consultation was requested to assess and assist with her seizure medication. The patient is a 3-year 3 months old girl with refractory epilepsy. She had been previously followed by XYZ, but has been under the care of the UCSF epilepsy program and recently by Dr. Y. I reviewed her pertinent previous neurology evaluations at CHCC and also interviewed mom.The patient had seizure breakthrough in August 2007, which requires inpatient admission, Thanksgiving and then after that time had seizures every other day, up-to-date early December. She remained seizure-free until 12/25/2007 when she had a breakthrough seizure at home treated with Diastat. She presented to our ER today with prolonged convulsive seizure despite receiving 20 mg of Diastat at home. Mom documented 103 temperature at home. In the ER, this was 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit. I reviewed the ER notes. At 0754 hours, she was having intermittent generalized tonic-clonic seizures despite receiving a total of 1.5 mg of lorazepam x5. UCSF fellow was contacted. She was given additional fosphenytoin and had a total dose of 15 mg/kg administered. Vital weight was 27. Seizures apparently had stopped. The valproic acid level obtained at 0835 hours was 79. According to mom, her last dose was at 6 p.m. and she did not receive her morning dose. Other labs slightly showed leukocytosis with white blood cell count 21,000 and normal CMP.Previous workup here showed an EEG on 2005, which showed a left posterior focus. MRI on June 2007 and January 2005 were within normal limits. Mom describes the following seizure types:1. Eye blinking with unresponsiveness.2. Staring off to one side.3. Focal motor activity in one arm and recently generalized tonic seizure.She also said that she was supposed to see Dr. Y this Friday, but had postponed it to some subsequent time when results of genetic testing would be available. She was being to physicians' care as Dr. Z had previously being following her last UCSF.She had failed most of the first and second line anti-epileptic drugs. These include Keppra, Lamictal, Trileptal, phenytoin and phenobarbital. These are elicited to allergies, but she has not had any true allergic reactions to these. Actually, it has resulted in an allergic reaction resulting in rash and hypotension.She also had been treated with Clobazam. Her best control is with her current regimen of valproic acid and Tranxene. Other attempts to taper Topamax, but this resulted increased seizures. She also has oligohidrosis during this summertime.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Include Diastat 20 mg; Topamax 25 mg b.i.d., which is 3.3 per kilo per day; Tranxene 15 mg b.i.d.; Depakote 125 mg t.i.d., which is 25 per kilo per day.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: Weight 15 kg.GENERAL: The patient was awake, she appeared sedated and postictal.NECK: Supple.NEUROLOGICAL: She had a few brief myoclonic jerks of her legs during drowsiness, but otherwise no overt seizure, no seizure activity nor involuntary movements were observed.She was able to follow commands such as when I request that she gave mom a kiss. She acknowledged her doll. Left fundus is sharp. She resisted the rest of the exam. There was no obvious lateralized findings.ASSESSMENT: Status epilepticus resolved. Triggered by a febrile illness, possibly viral. Refractory remote symptomatic partial epilepsy.IMPRESSION: I discussed the maximizing Depakote to mom and she concurred. I recommend increasing her maintenance dose to one in the morning, one in the day, and two at bedtime. For today, she did give an IV Depacon 250 mg and the above dosage can be continued IV until she is taking p.o. Dr. X agreed with the changes and orders were written for this. She can continue her current doses of Topamax and Tranxene. This can be given by NG if needed. Topamax can be potentially increased to 25 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night. I will be available as needed during the rest of her hospitalization. Mom will call contact Dr. Y an update him about the recent changes."
409,Neurology,"REASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION: Muscle twitching, clumsiness, progressive pain syndrome, and gait disturbance.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62-year-old African-American male with a significant past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke in 2002 with minimal residual right-sided weakness as well as two MIs, status post pacemaker insertion who first presented with numbness in his lower extremities in 2001. He states that since that time these symptoms have been progressive and now involving his legs above his knees as well as his hands. More recently, he describes a burning sensation along with numbness. This has become a particular problem and of all the problems he has he feels that pain is his primary concern. Over the last six months, he has noticed that he cannot feel hot objects in his hands and that objects slip out of his hands. He denies any weakness per se, just clumsiness and decreased sensation. He has also been complaining of brief muscle jerks, which occur in both hands and his shoulders. This has been a fairly longstanding problem, and again has become more prevalent recently. He does not have any tremor. He denies any neck pain. He walks with the aid of a walker because of unsteadiness with gait.Recently, he has tried gabapentin, but this was not effective for pain control. Oxycodone helps somewhat and gives him at least three hours pain relief. Because of the pain, he has significant problems with fractured sleep. He states he has not had a good night's sleep in many years. About six months ago, after an MI and pacemaker insertion, he was transferred to a nursing facility. At that facility, his insulin was stopped. Since then he has only been on oral medication for his diabetes. He denies any back pain, neck pain, change in bowel or bladder function, or specific injury pre-dating these symptoms.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, arthritis, GERD, and headaches.MEDICATIONS: Trazodone, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, Prevacid, lisinopril, glipizide, and gabapentin.FAMILY HISTORY: Discussed above and documented on the chart.SOCIAL HISTORY: Discussed above and documented on the chart. He does not smoke. He lives in a senior citizens building with daily nursing aids. He previously was a security guard, but is currently on disability.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Discussed above and documented on the chart.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, blood pressure 150/80, pulse of 80, respiratory rate 22, and weight 360 pounds. Pain scale 7/10. A full general and neurological examination was performed on the patient and is documented on the chart.The patient is obese with significant ankle edema.Neurological examination reveals normal cognitive exam and normal cranial nerve examination. Motor examination reveals mild atrophy in bilateral FDIs, but still has a strong grip. Individual muscle strength is close to normal with only subtle weakness found in ankle plantar and dorsiflexion. Tone and bulk are normal. Sensory examination reveals a severe decrease to all modalities in his lower extremities from just above the knees distally. He has no vibration sense at his knees. Similarly, there is decrease to all sensory modalities in his both upper extremities from just above the wrist distally. The only reflexes I could obtain with trace reflexes in his biceps. Remaining reflexes were unelicitable. No Babinski. The patient walks normally with the aid of a cane. He has severe sensory ataxia with inability to walk unaided. Positive Romberg with eyes open and closed.IMPRESSION AND PLAN:1. Probable painful diabetic neuropathy. Symptoms are predominantly sensory and severely dysfunctioning, with the patient having inability to ambulate independently as well as difficulty with grip and temperature differentiation in his upper extremities. He has relative preservation of motor function. Because these symptoms are progressive and, by report, he came off his insulin, suggesting somewhat mild diabetes, I would like to rule out other causes of progressive neuropathy.2. He has history of myoclonic jerks. I did not see any on my examination today and I feel that these are benign and probably secondary to his severe insomnia, which he states is secondary to the painful neuropathy. I would like to rule out other causes such as hepatic encephalopathy.I have recommended the following:1. EMG/nerve conduction study to assess severity of neuropathy and to characterize neuropathy.2. Blood work, looking for other causes of neuropathy and myoclonus, to include CBC, CMP, TSH, LFT, B12, RPR, ESR, Lyme titer, and HbA1c, and ammonia level.3. Neurontin and oxycodone have not been effective, and I have recommended Cymbalta starting at 30 mg q.d. for five days and then increasing to 60 mg q.d. Side effect profile of this medication was discussed with the patient.4. I have explained to him that progression of diabetic neuropathy is closely related to diabetic control and I have recommended tight diabetic control.5. I will see him at followup at the EMG."
410,Neurology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom. At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell. He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him. He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal.He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him. This was not preceded by lightheadedness. He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia. He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day. He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way. Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this. He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this. He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline. In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles. He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit. He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything. He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks. He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands. He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse. He has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in August 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs. He does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing. He reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder. He has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands. He also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges. This has been present for about nine months. He has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Pneumonia. He has had recurrent episodes of pneumonia, which started at approximately age 20. These have been treated repeatedly over the years, and on average he has tended to have an episode of pneumonia once every five years, although this has been far more frequent in the past year. He is usually treated with antibiotics and then discharged. There is no known history of bronchiectasis, inherited lung disease or another chronic pulmonary cause for the repeated pneumonia.2. He has had a catheter placed for urinary retention, his urologist has told him that he thinks that this may be due to prostate enlargement. The patient does not have any history of diabetes and does not report any other medical problems. He has lost approximately 18 pounds in the past month.3. He had an appendectomy in the 1940s.4. He had an ankle resection in 1975.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient stopped smoking 27 years ago, he smoked approximately two packs a day with combined cigarettes and cigars. He has not smoked for the past 27 years. He hardly ever uses alcohol. He is currently retired.FAMILY HISTORY: There is no family history of neuropathy, pes cavus, foot deformities, or neuromuscular diseases. His aunt has a history of type II diabetes.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Fludrocortisone 0.1 mg p.o. q.d., midodrine 5 mg p.o. q.i.d., Cymbalta 30 mg p.o. per day, Prilosec 20 mg p.o. per day, Lortab 10 mg p.o. per day, Amoxil 500 mg p.o. per day, vitamin B12 1000 mcg weekly, vitamin D 1000 units per day, Metamucil p.r.n., enteric-coated aspirin once a day, Colace 200 mg p.o. q.d., Senokot three tablets p.o. p.r.n., Reglan 10 mg p.o. q.6h., Xanax 0.25 mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n., Ambien 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. and Dilaudid 2 mg tablets p.o. q.3h. p.r.n., Protonix 40 mg per day, and Megace 400 mg per day.ALLERGIES: He has no medication or food allergies.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Please see the health questionnaire and clinical notes from today.GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: BP was 137/60, P was 89, and his weight could not be measured because he was in a wheelchair. His pain score was 0.APPEARANCE: No acute distress. He is pleasant and well-groomed.HEENT: Atraumatic, normocephalic. No carotid bruits appreciated.LUNGS: There were few coarse crackles in both lung bases.CARDIOVASCULAR: Revealed a normal first and second heart sound, with no third or fourth heart sound and no murmurs. The pulse was regular and of normal volume.ABDOMEN: Soft with no masses and normal bowel sounds. There were no carotid bruits.EXTREMITIES: No contractures appreciated.NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:MSE: His orientation, language, calculations, 100-7 tests were all normal. There was atrophy and fasciculations in both the arms and legs.CRANIAL NERVES: Cranial nerve examination was normal with the exception that there was some mild atrophy of his tongue and possible fasciculations. His palatal movement was normal and gag reflex was normal.MOTOR: Strength was decreased in all muscle groups as follows: Deltoid 4/4, biceps 4+/4+, triceps 5/5, wrist extensors 4+/4+, finger extensors 4-/4-, finger flexors 4-/4-, interossei 4-/4-, hip flexors 4+/4+, hip extensors 4+/4+, knee extensors 4/4, and knee flexors 4/4. Foot dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, toe extension and toe flexion was all 0 to 1. There was atrophy in both hands and general atrophy of the lower limb muscles. The feet were both cold and showed dystrophic features. Fasciculations were present mainly in the hands. There was evidence of dysmetria and past pointing in the left hand.REFLEXES: Reflexes were 0 in all sites in the arms and legs. The jaw reflex was 2+. Vibration was severely decreased at the elbow and wrist and was absent in the fingers. Vibration was absent in the toes and ankle bilaterally and was severely decreased at the knee. Joint position sense was absent in the toes and severely decreased in the fingers. Pin perception was absent in the feet and was decreased to the upper thighs. Pin was decreased or absent in the fingers and decreased above the elbows. The same distribution of sensory loss was found with monofilament testing.COORDINATION: Coordination was barely normal in the right hand. Rapid alternating movements were decreased in the left hand greater than the right hand. The patient was unable to stand and therefore gait, Romberg's test and balance could not be assessed.DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: Previous diagnostic studies and patient reports. There were extensive patient reports, all of which were reviewed. A previous x-ray study of the lateral chest performed in October 2008 showed poor inspiration with basilar atelectasis and an infiltrate. An x-ray of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine showed some evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis. A CTA of the neck with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed minor stenosis in the left carotid, a mild hard and soft plaque in the right carotid with approximately 55% stenosis. The posterior circulation showed a slightly dominant right vertebral artery with no stenosis. There was no significant stenosis, but there was minor extracranial stenosis noted. An MRI of the brain with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed no evidence of an acute infarct, major vascular occlusion, and no abnormal enhancement with gadolinium administration. There was also no significant sinusitis or mastoiditis. This was an essentially normal brain MRI. A CBC performed in January 2009 showed an elevated white cell count of 11.3, a low red cell count of 3.43, elevated MCH of 32.4 and the rest of the study was normal. An electrolyte study performed in January 2009 showed a sodium which was low at 127, a calcium which was low at 8.3, and a low protein of 5.2 and albumin of 3.1. The glucose was 86. TSH performed in January 2009 was 1.57, which is within the normal range. Vitamin B12 was greater than a 1000, which is normal and the folate was 18.2, which was normal. A myocardial stress study performed in December 2008 showed normal myocardial perfusion with Persantine Cardiolite SPECT. The ECG was non-diagnostic. There was normal regional wall motion of the left ventricle. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 68%, which is within the normal range for males. A CT of the lumbar spine without contrast performed in December 2008 showed a broad-based disc bulge at L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4 and L4-L5. At L5-S1, in addition to the broad-based disc bulge, there was also an osteophyte complex and evidence of flavum hypertrophy without canal stenosis. There was severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at L1-L4. An echocardiogram was performed in November 2008 and showed mild left atrial enlargement, normal left ventricular systolic function, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, scleral degenerative changes in the aortic and mitral apparatus, mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: The patient presents with a severe neuropathy with marked large fiber sensory as well as motor findings. He is diffusely weak as well as atrophic in all muscle groups both in his upper and lower extremities, although he is disproportionately weak in his lower extremities. His proprioceptive and vibratory loss is severe in both the distal upper and lower extremities, signifying that he either has a severe sensory neuropathy or has involvement of the dorsal root ganglia. According to the history, which was carefully checked, the initial onset of these symptoms goes back one and a half years, although there has only been significant progression in his condition since July 2008. As indicated below, further diagnostic studies including a detailed nerve conduction and EMG test today showed evidence of a severe sensory, motor, and axonal neuropathy and in addition there was evidence of a diffuse polyradiculopathy. There was no involvement of the tongue on EMG. The laboratory testing as indicated below failed to show a specific cause for the neuropathy. We are still, however, waiting for the paraneoplastic antibodies, which were send out lab to the Mayo Clinic. This type of very severe sensorimotor neuropathy with significant proprioceptive loss may be seen in several conditions including peripheral nerve vasculitis due to a variety of disorders such as SLE, Sjogren's, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed connective tissue disease. In addition, it may also be seen with certain toxins, particularly chemotherapeutic agents. The patient did not receive any of these. It may also be seen as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome. Although the patient does not have any specific clinical symptoms of a cancer, it is noted that he has had an 18-pound weight loss in the past month and does have a remote history of smoking. We have requested that he obtain a CT of his chest, abdomen and pelvis while he is in Acute Rehabilitation. The verbal reports of these possibly did not show any evidence of a cancer. We did also request that he obtain a gallium scan to see if there was any evidence of an unsuspected neoplasm. The patient did undergo a nerve and muscle biopsy, this was a radial nerve and biceps muscle biopsy from the left arm. This showed evidence of severe axonal loss. There was no evidence of a vasculitis. The vessels did show some mild intimal changes that would be consistent with atherosclerosis. There were a few perivascular changes; however, there was no clear evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis even on multiple sections. The muscle biopsy showed severe muscle fiber atrophy, with evidence of fiber grouping. Again, there was no evidence of inflammation or vasculitis. Evaluation so far has also shown no evidence of an amyloid neuropathy, no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy, of sarcoidosis, and again there is no past history of a significant toxin or infective cause for the neuropathy. Specifically, there is no history of HIV exposure. We would await the results of the gallium scan and of the paraneoplastic antibodies to see if these are helpful in making a diagnosis. At this point, because of the severity and the axonal nature of the neuropathy, there is no specific therapy that will reverse the course of the illness, unless we find a specific etiology that can be stopped or reversed. I have discussed these issues at length with the patient and with his son. We also addressed whether or not there might be a previously undiagnosed inherited neuropathy. I think this is unlikely given the short history and the rapid progression of the disorder.There is also no family history that we can detect a neuropathy, and the patient does not have the typical phenotype for a chronic inherited neuropathy such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2. However, since I have only seen the patient on one occasion and do not know what his previous examination showed two years ago, I cannot be certain that there may not have been the presence of a neuropathy preceding this.PLAN:1. Nerve conduction and EMG will be performed today. The results were indicated above.2. The following laboratory studies were requested including electrolytes, CBC, thyroid function tests, B12, ANA, C-reactive protein, complement, cryoglobulins, double-stranded DNA antibodies, folate level, hemoglobin A1c, immunofixation electrophoresis, P-ANCA, C-ANCA, protein electrophoresis, rheumatoid factor, paraneoplastic antibody studies requested from the Mayo Clinic, B12. These studies showed minor changes, which included a low sodium level of 129 as previously noted, a low creatinine of 0.74, low calcium of 8.6, low total protein of 5.7. The B12 was greater than 2000. The immunoelectrophoresis, ANA, double-stranded DNA, ANCA, hemoglobin A1c, folate, cryoglobulins, complement, C-reactive protein were all normal or negative. The B12 level was greater than 2000. Liver function tests were normal. The glucose was 90. ESR was 10. Hemoglobin A1c was 5.5.3. A left radial sensory and left biceps biopsy were requested and have been performed and interpreted as indicated above.4. CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis.5. Whole body gallium scan for evidence of an underlying neoplasm.6. The patient will go to the Rehabilitation Facility for Acute Rehabilitation and Training.7. We have not made any changes to his medication. He does have some mild orthostatic changes; however, he is adequately controlled with midodrine at a dose of 2.5 mg three times a day as needed up to 5 mg four times a day. Usually, he uses a lower dose of 2.5 three times a day to 5 mg three times a day.8. Followup will be as determined by the family."
411,Neurology,"NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: At present the patient is awake, alert and fully oriented. There is no evidence of cognitive or language dysfunction. Cranial nerves: Visual fields are full. Funduscopic examination is normal. Extraocular movements full. Pupils equal, round, react to light. There is no evidence of nystagmus noted. Fifth nerve function is normal. There is no facial asymmetry noted. Lower cranial nerves are normal. Manual motor testing reveals good tone and bulk throughout. There is no evidence of pronator drift or decreased fine finger movements. Muscle strength is 5/5 throughout. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ throughout with downgoing toes. Sensory examination is intact to all modalities including stereognosis, graphesthesia.TESTING OF STATION AND GAIT: The patient is able to walk toe-heel and tandem walk. Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin moves are normal. Romberg sign negative. I appreciate no carotid bruits or cardiac murmurs.Noncontrast CT scan of the head shows no evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage or extra-axial collection."
412,Neurology,"PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSES:1. Contusion of the frontal lobe of the brain.2. Closed head injury and history of fall.3. Headache, probably secondary to contusion.FINAL DIAGNOSES:1. Contusion of the orbital surface of the frontal lobes bilaterally.2. Closed head injury.3. History of fall.COURSE IN THE HOSPITAL: This is a 29-year-old male, who fell at home. He was seen in the emergency room due to headache. CT of the brain revealed contusion of the frontal lobe near the falx. The patient did not have any focal signs. He was admitted to ABCD. Neurology consultation was obtained. Neuro checks were done. The patient continued to remain stable, although he had some frontal headache. He underwent an MRI to rule out extension of the contusion or the possibility of a bleed and the MRI of the brain without contrast revealed findings consistent with contusion of the orbital surface of the frontal lobes bilaterally near the interhemispheric fissure. The patient remained clinically stable and his headache resolved. He was discharged home on 11/6/2008.PLAN: Discharge the patient to home.ACTIVITY: As tolerated.The patient has been advised to call if the headache is recurrent and Tylenol 650 mg 1 p.o. q.6 h. p.r.n. headache. The patient has been advised to follow up with me as well as the neurologist in about 1 week."
413,Neurology,"REASON FOR EVALUATION: The patient is a 37-year-old white single male admitted to the hospital through the emergency room. I had seen him the day before in my office and recommended him to go into the hospital. He had just come from a trip to Taho in Nevada and he became homicidal while there. He started having thoughts about killing his mother. He became quite frightened by that thought and called me during the weekend we were able to see him on that Tuesday after talking to him.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a patient that has been suffering from a chronic psychotic condition now for a number of years. He began to have symptoms when he was approximately 18 or 19 with auditory and visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions. He was using drugs and smoking marijuana at that time has experimenting with LXV and another drugs too. The patient has not used any drugs since age 25. However, he has continued having intense and frequent psychotic bouts. I have seen him now for approximately one year. He has been quite refractory to treatment. We tried different types of combination of medications, which have included Clozaril, Risperdal, lithium, and Depakote with partial response and usually temporary. The patient has had starting with probably has had some temporary relief of the symptoms and they usually do not last more than a few days. The dosages that we have used have been very high. He has been on Clozaril 1200 mg combined with Risperdal up to 9 mg and lithium at a therapeutic level. However, he has not responded.He has delusions of antichrist. He strongly believes that the dogs have a home in the neighborhood are communicating with him and criticizing him and he believes that all the people can communicate to him with telepathy including the animals. He has paranoid delusions. He also gets homicidal like prior to this admission.PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: As mentioned before, this patient has been psychotic off and on for about 20 years now. He has had years in which he did better on Clozaril and also his other medications.With typical anti-psychotics, he has done well at times, but he eventually gets another psychotic bout.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has a history of obesity and also of diabetes mellitus. However, most recently, he has not been treated for diabetes since his last regular weight since he stopped taking Zyprexa. The patient has chronic bronchitis. He smokes cigarettes constantly up to 60 a day.DRUG HISTORY: He stopped using drugs when he was 25. He has got a lapse, but he was more than 10 years and he has been clean ever since then. As mentioned before, he smokes cigarettes quite heavily and which has been a problem for his health since he also has chronic bronchitis.PSYCHOSOCIAL STATUS: The patient lives with his mother and has been staying with her for a few years now. We have talked to her. She is very supportive. His only sister is also very supportive of him. He has lived in the ABCD houses in the past. He has done poorly in some of them.MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION: The patient appeared alert, oriented to time, place, and person. His affect is flat. He talked about auditory hallucinations, which are equivocal in nature. He is not homicidal in the hospital as he was when he was at home. His voice and speech are normal. He believes in telepathy. His memory appears intact and his intelligence is calculated as average.INITIAL DIAGNOSES:AXIS I: Schizophrenia.AXIS II: Deferred.AXIS III: History of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and chronic bronchitis.AXIS IV: Moderate.AXIS V: GAF of 35 on admission.INITIAL TREATMENT AND PLAN: Since, the patient has been on high dosages of medications, we will give him a holiday and a structured environment. We will put him on benzodiazepines and make a decision anti-psychotic later. We will make sure that he is safe and that he addresses his medical needs well."
414,Neurology,"REASON FOR REFERRAL: The patient was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X. A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess neuropsychological factors, clarify areas of strength and weakness, and to assist in therapeutic program planning in light of episodes of syncope.BRIEF SUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS:RELEVANT HISTORY:Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and an interview with the patient.The patient presented to Dr. X on August 05, 2008 as she had been recently hospitalized for prolonged episodes of syncope. She was referred to Dr. X for diagnostic differentiation for possible seizures or other causes of syncope. The patient reports an extensive neurological history. Her mother used alcohol during her pregnancy with the patient. In spite of exposure to alcohol in utero, the patient reported that she achieved ""honors in school"" and ""looked smart."" She reported that she began to experience migraines at 11 years of age. At 15 years of age, she reported that she was thought to have hydrocephalus. She reported that she will frequently ""bang her head against the wall"" to relieve the pain. The patient gave birth to her daughter at 17 years of age. At 18 years of age, she received a spinal tap as a procedure to determine the cause of her severe headaches. She reported, in 1995 to 1996 she experienced a severe head injury, as she was struck by a car as a pedestrian and ""thrown two and a half city blocks."" The patient reported that she could recall before being hit, but could not recall the activities of that same day or the following day. She reported that she had difficulty walking following this head injury, but received rehabilitation for approximately one month. Her migraines became more severe following the head injury. In 1998, she reportedly was experiencing episodes of syncope where she would experience a headache with photophobia, phonophobia, and flashing lights. Following the syncope episode, she would experience some confusion. These episodes reportedly were related to her donating plasma.The patient also reported that her ex-husband stated that she frequently jerked and would shake in her sleep. She reported that upon awakening, she would feel off balanced and somewhat confused. These episodes diminished from 2002 to June 2008. When making dinner, she suddenly dropped and hit the back of her head on refrigerator. She reported that she was unconscious for five to six minutes. A second episode occurred on July 20th when she lost consciousness for may be a full day. She was admitted to Sinai Hospital and assessed by a neurologist. Her EEG and head CT were considered to be completely normal. She did not report any typical episodes during the time of her 36-hour EEG. She reported that her last episode of syncope occurred prior to her being hospitalized. She stated that she had an aura of her ears ringing, vision being darker and ""tunnel vision"" (vision goes smaller to a pinpoint), and she was ""spazzing out"" on the floor. During these episodes, she reports that she cannot talk and has difficulty understanding.The patient also reports that she has experienced some insomnia since she was 6 years old. She reported that she was a heavy drinker until about 1998 or 1999 and that she would drink a gallon daily of Jack Daniel. She stopped the use of alcohol and that time she experienced a suicide attempt. In 2002, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was started on medication. At the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, she had stopped taking her medicine as she felt that she was now in remission and could manage her symptoms herself. The patient's medical history is also significant for postpartum depression.The patient reported that she has been experiencing difficulty with cognitive abilities of attention/concentration, spelling, tangential and slow thinking, poor sequencing memory for events, and variable verbal memory. She reported that she sometimes has difficulty understanding what people say, specifically she has difficulty understanding jokes. She finds that she often has difficulty with expressing her thoughts, as she is very tangential. She experiences episodes of not recalling what she was speaking of or remembering what activities she was trying to perform. She reported that she had a photographic memory for directions. She said that she experienced a great deal of emotional lability, but in general her personality has become more subdued. At the present time, her daughter has now moved on to college. The patient is living with her biological mother. Although she is going through divorce, she reported that it was not really stressful. She reported that she spends her day driving other people around and trying to be helpful to them.At the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, the patient's medication included Ativan, Imitrex, Levoxyl, vitamin B12, albuterol metered dose inhaler as needed, and Zofran as needed. (It should be noted that The patient by the time of the feedback on September 19, 2008 had resumed taking her Trileptal for bipolar disorder.). The patient's familial medical history is significant for alcohol abuse, diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol.TESTS ADMINISTERED:Clinical InterviewCognistatMattis Dementia Rating ScaleWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - III (WAIS-III)Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI)Selected Subtests from the Delis Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) Trail Making Test Verbal Fluency (Letter Fluency & Category Fluency) Design Fluency Color-Word Interference Test TowerWisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)Stroop TestColor TrailsTrails A & BTest of Variables of AttentionMultilingual Aphasia Examination II Token Test Sentence Repetition Visual Naming Controlled Oral Word Association Spelling Test Aural Comprehension Reading ComprehensionBoston Naming Test-2 (BNT-2)Animal Naming TestThe Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration (VMI)The Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Motor CoordinationThe Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual PerceptionJudgment Line OrientationGrooved PegboardPurdue PegboardFinger Tapping TestRey Complex FigureWechsler Memory Scale -III (WMS-III)California Verbal Learning TestWoodcock Johnson Achievement Test IIIWide Range Achievement Test - IVBeck Depression Inventory (BDI)State-Trait Inventory (STAIC)Adult History QuestionnaireBehavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)Adaptive Behavior Assessment SystemBEHAVIOR OBSERVATIONS: The patient presented as a well-dressed and African-American woman who developed a rapport with the examiner. She appeared somewhat anxious and started the evaluation on the edge of her chair, although she eventually tended to relax more. Overall, her affect and mood were appropriate for the evaluation. Her speech was slightly above normal for rate, speed, and intensity. She was slightly tangential. She appeared to have no difficulty comprehending or expressing herself. Her performance was notable for poor cognitive flexibility and impulsivity. She also demonstrated mild psychomotor slowing. The patient was right-handed for writing and drawing. Overall, she demonstrated adequate rates of attention/concentration, cooperation, and perseverance. Therefore, the following evaluation is considered to be an accurate reflection of her current cognitive abilities.EVALUATION FINDINGS:Classification Level Percentile Rank Standard Score Scaled Score T-ScoreSuperior > 95 120 > 14 > 66High Average 76-95 11-124 13-14 58-66Average 25-75 90-110 8-12 44-57Low Average 9-24 80-89 7 37-43Borderline 9-10 70-79 6 30-36Mildly Impaired 5-8 < 70 4-5 < 30Moderately Impaired 2-4 3 Deficient/Impaired < 2 1-2 ORIENTATION: The patient was oriented to person, place, and time.GENERAL COGNITIVE ABILITY: The patient's overall intellectual ability fell in the average range. There was no statistically significant discrepancy between her verbal and her performance (nonverbal) intellect.ATTENTION/ EXECUTIVE FUNCTION: The patient did well on measures of verbal and design fluency as her performance fell in the average range. On a trial making task, she did well on all versions of the test including number, letter sequencing with the exception of the motor speed task. On this measure, she did not listen fully to the instructions and reduced her speed. On a color word interference task, her performance for inhibiting responses fell in low average range and was a subtle change from her high end of average performance on color naming and word reading. On measures of visual and verbal working memory, her performance was solidly in the average range.The patient completed a valid Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning. On this measure, she indicated that she was experiencing difficulties with cognitive inflexibility, emotional dyscontrol, and poor working memory.LANGUAGE FUNCTION: The patient had a difficulty with measures that are related more to verbal comprehension. She had significant difficulty with repeating sentences and difficulty with following commands. On the command comprehension measure, she had difficulty with sequencing and two-step commands. On sentence repetition, she had difficulty remembering the details of the sentence that she repeated. On a naming to command measure, her performance fell in the average range and on the verbal fluency measure both semantic and phonemic, her performance fell in the average range. Overall, this pattern of performance suggests mild receptive language difficulties and difficulty with sequencing.VISUAL-SPATIAL & VISUAL-MOTOR FUNCTION: On a visual spatial discrimination task, her performance fell solidly in the average range. On a measure of fine motor manual dexterity, her right hand and left hand performance fell in the average range and when she was required to use both hands simultaneously, her performance decreased slightly into the low average range.LEARNING & MEMORY SKILLS: On a five-trial 16-item verbal list learning measure, the patient's rate of acquisition fell in the high average range. When a interference list was introduced, she had some difficulty learning the interference list as she could only recall 25% of the words. However, following the introduction of this list, she was still able to recall 15 of the 16 words from the original list. Following a 20-minute delay, she was able to recall 15 of the 16 words. She entirely used a semantic cluster strategy. Overall, her performance fell in the high average range on this measure. On a story (prose) verbal memory measure, her immediate and delayed (30 minute) recall both fell in the high average range.On the copy of the complex geometric design, her visual spatial organization was poor and her performance fell in the low average range. Her immediate recall of the design fell in the borderline range and following a 30-minute delay, she lost even more details to decline into the mildly impaired range. In general, her copy of the design was notable for its lack of overall configuration and good stop. Her immediate recall failed to maintain a good stop overall configuration design and was void of details. The design further decompensated after a 30-minute delay as she lost further configuration and details. It is thought that her poor performance on this could represent some difficulty in visual memory, but most likely is due to poor initial encoding and organization of the design. On facial recognition task, her immediate recognition of the faces fell in the high average range. Following a 30-minute delay, though her performance declined to the low end of average, this is a significant discrepancy and suggested that she did have difficulty retaining and retrieving the information that she had stored. Therefore, a subtle mild weakness is in visual spatial memory.ACADEMIC FUNCTION:BEHAVIORAL/EMOTIONAL FUNCTION: The patient was administered a MMPI-2. Her responses unfortunately were completely invalid due to an over endorsement of symptoms. Typically, an over endorsement of symptoms is indicative of significant affective distress or a need for attention. On this measure, The patient reported an elevated level of affective distress and unusual ideation. Her profile is consistent with patients who may demonstrate their affective distress through physical means. Overall, this pattern should be interpreted very cautiously due to the invalid nature of the profile.SUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS: The patient was referred by neurologist for a neuropsychological evaluation for diagnostic clarity, and specific recommendations for medical and psychological intervention in light of undiagnosed episodes of syncope.In summary, the patient's neuropsychological evaluation revealed selective deficits of executive system dysfunction, mild receptive language difficulties (partially due to executive system dysfunction) and subtle visual memory storage and retrieval superimposed upon an average level of intellect. Her MMPI-2 was invalid, but indicated that she was undergoing significant stress and that she is more likely to demonstrate her stress through physical and cognitive rather than emotional display.The patient's neurobehavioral risk factors are significant for chronic history of migraines, bipolar disorder, depression, reported in utero exposure to alcohol, history of heavy substance abuse, and use of neuropsychiatric medication. Bipolar affective disorder is known to impact executive system dysfunction as patients have difficulty with impulsivity, cognitive flexibility, working memory, emotional control, and self-monitoring. The patient's performance is certainly consistent with this report. Medication can also have an effect on executive system functioning and attention/concentration. Despite this, it is far better for her to have access to neuropsychiatric medication to balance her mood swings. There was some mild evidence of decreased visual spatial memory for retrieval in contrast to high average verbal memory. Although she had difficulty on measures of comprehension, it was likely due to decreased attention and concentration given that she was able to perform other tasks that require receptive language very well (verbal memory). Given The patient's history, she has done extraordinarily well and many of her cognitive abilities are intact, which allow her to function at a very high level. It is strongly recommended that she share these results with her psychiatrist/psychologist to assist in any treatment planning for her and to continue to make positive and achievable goals for The patient.You may wish to consider the following recommendations to improve The patient's quality of life.RECOMMENDATIONS:MEDICAL:1. Please share these results with Dr. X to determine any need to change in her medical treatment.2. It is critical that the patient take care of herself and reduce her distress. In particular, she should make sure that she has a normalized sleeping pattern and she is eating appropriately and getting appropriate rest.Psychological:1. She should share these results with her psychiatrist/psychologist, to assess for any change in her current psychological treatment.2. It is likely that the patient will need to stay on medication to treat her bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder does not go into remission and sadly is a chronic disorder.3. In psychotherapy, it is important for goals to be set for the patient and that she can achieve those goals. It is apparent that she is frequently feeling overwhelmed and does not understand how to be able to take care of herself and ways that are not needing medical care. Goals to increase her sleep and reduce her stress may be fundamental, but are certainly required in her case.OCCUPATIONAL: The patient has many strong abilities and with balance of her emotional life, there is no reason why she cannot return to work. Her work setting should be in a well structured place with minimal multitasking and will keep a people contact."
415,Neurology,"REASON FOR REFERRAL: The patient is a 76-year-old Caucasian gentleman who works full-time as a tax attorney. He was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after a recent hospitalization for possible transient ischemic aphasia. Two years ago, a similar prolonged confusional spell was reported as well. A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient. A summary of pertinent information is presented below. Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM: The patient was brought to the Hospital Emergency Department on 09/30/09 after experiencing an episode of confusion for which he has no recall the previous day. He has no recollection of the event. The following information is obtained from his medical record. On 09/29/09, he reportedly went to a five-hour meeting and stated several times ""I do not feel well"" and looked ""glazed."" He does not remember anything from midmorning until the middle of the night and when his wife came home, she found him in bed at 6 p.m., which is reportedly unusual. She thought he was warm and had chills. He later returned to his baseline. He was seen by Dr. X in the hospital on 09/30/09 and reported to him at that time that he felt that he had returned entirely to baseline. His neurological exam at that time was unremarkable aside from missing one of three items on recall for the Mini-Mental Status Examination. Due to mild memory complaints from himself and his wife, he was referred for more extensive neuropsychological testing. Note that reportedly when his wife found him in bed, he was shaking and feeling nauseated, somewhat clammy and kept saying that he could not remember anything and he was repeating himself, asking the same questions in an agitated way, so she brought him to the emergency room. The patient had an episode two years ago of transient loss of memory during which he was staring blankly while sitting at his desk at work and the episode lasted approximately two hours. He was hospitalized at Hospital at that time as well and evaluation included negative EEG, MRI showing mild atrophy, and a neurological consultation, which did not result in a specific diagnosis, but during this episode he was also reportedly nauseous. He was also reportedly amnestic for this episode.In 2004, he had a sense of a funny feeling in his neck and electrodes in his head and had an MRI at that time which showed some small vessel changes.During this interview, the patient reported that other than a coworker noticing a few careless errors in his completion of some documents and his wife reporting some mild memory changes that he had not noticed any significant decline. He thought that his memory abilities were similar to those of his peers of his same age. When I asked about this episode, he said he had no recall of it at all and that he ""felt fine the whole time."" He appeared to be somewhat questioning of the validity of reports that he was amnestic and confused at that time. So, The patient reported some age related ""memory lapses"" such as going into a room and forgetting why, sometimes putting something down and forgetting where he had put it. However, he reported that these were entirely within normal expectations and he denied any type of impairment in his ability to continue to work full-time as a tax attorney other than his wife and one coworker, he had not received any feedback from his children or friends of any problems. He denied any missed appointments, any difficulty scheduling and maintaining appointments. He does not have to recheck information for errors. He is able to complete tasks in the same amount of time as he always has. He reported that he has not made additional errors in tasks that he completed. He said he does write everything down, but has always done things that way. He reported that he works in a position that requires a high level of attentiveness and knowledge and that will become obvious very quickly if he was having difficulties or making mistakes. He did report some age related changes in attention as well, although very mild and he thought these were normal and not more than he would expect for his age. He remains completely independent in his ADLs. He denied any difficulty with driving or maintaining any activities that he had always participated in. He is also able to handle their finances. He did report significant stress recently particularly in relation to his work environment.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes coronary artery disease, status post CABG in 1991, radical prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy, nephrectomy for the same cancer, hypertension, lumbar surgery done twice previously, lumbar stenosis many years ago in the 1960s and 1970s, now followed by Dr. Y with another lumbar surgery scheduled to be done shortly after this evaluation, and hyperlipidemia. Note that due to back pain, he had been taking Percocet daily prior to his hospitalization.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Celebrex 200 mg, levothyroxine 0.025 mg, Vytorin 10/40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, Coreg 10 mg, glucosamine with chondroitin, prostate 2.2, aspirin 81 mg, and laxative stimulant or stool softener. Note that medical records say that he was supposed to be taking Lipitor 40 mg, but it is not clear if he was doing so and also there was no specific reason found for why he was taking the levothyroxine.OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: Surgical history is significant for hernia repair in 2007 as well. The patient reported drinking an occasional glass of wine approximately two days of the week. He quit smoking cigarettes 25 to 30 years ago and he was diagnosed with cancer. He denied any illicit drug use. Please add that his prostatectomy was done in 1993 and nephrectomy in 1983 for carcinoma. He also had right carpal tunnel surgery in 2005 and has cholelithiasis. Upon discharge from the hospital, the patient's sleep deprived EEG was recommended.MRI completed on 09/30/09 showed ""mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with no significant interval change from a prior study dated June 15, 2007. No evidence of acute intracranial processes identified. CT scan was also unremarkable showing only mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. EEG was negative. Deferential diagnosis was transient global amnesia versus possible seizure disorder. Note that he also reportedly has some hearing changes, but has not followed up with an evaluation for hearing aid.FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: Reportedly significant for TIAs in his mother, although the patient did not report this during our evaluation and so that she had no memory problems or dementia when she passed away of old age at the age of 85. In addition, his father had a history of heart disease and passed away at the age of 75. He has one sister with diabetes and thought his mom might have had diabetes as well.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient obtained a law degree from the University of Baltimore. He did not complete his undergraduate degree from the University of Maryland because he was able to transfer his credits in order to attend law school at that time. He reported that he did not obtain very good grades until he reached law school, at which point he graduated in the top 10 of his class and had no problem passing the Bar. He thought that effort and motivation were important to his success in his school and he had not felt very motivated previously. He reported that he repeated math classes ""every year of school"" and attended summer school every year due to that. He has worked as a tax attorney for the past 48 years and reported having a thriving practice with clients all across the country. He served also in the U.S. Coast Guard between 1951 and 1953. He has been married for the past 36 years to his wife, Linda, who is a homemaker. They have four children and he reported having good relationship with them. He described being very active. He goes for dancing four to five times a week, swims daily, plays golf regularly and spends significant amounts of time socializing with friends.PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: The patient denied any history of psychological or psychiatric treatment. He reported that some stressors occasionally contribute to mildly low mood at this time, but that these are transient.TASKS ADMINISTERED:Clinical InterviewAdult History QuestionnaireWechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR)Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE)Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status ExaminationRepeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX)Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2)Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB)Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III)Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV)Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI)Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA)Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT)Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT)Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention TestSymbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II) Token Test Sentence Repetition Visual Naming Controlled Oral Word Association Spelling Test Aural Comprehension Reading ComprehensionBoston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2)Animal Naming TestControlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT: F-A-S)The Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration (VMI)The Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Motor CoordinationThe Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual PerceptionHooper Visual Organization Test (VOT)Judgment of Line Orientation (JOLO)Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT)Wechsler Memory Scale, Third Edition (WMS-III)Wechsler Memory Scale, Fourth Edition (WMS-IV)California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition (CVLT-II)Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Trail Making Test Verbal Fluency (Letter & Category) Design Fluency Color-Word Interference Test TowerWisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)Stroop Color-Word TestColor TrailsTrail Making Test A & BWide Range Achievement Test, Fourth Edition (WRAT-IV)Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement, Third Edition (WJ-III)Nelson-Denny Reading TestGrooved PegboardPurdue PegboardFinger Tapping TestBeck Depression Inventory (BDI)Mood Assessment Scale (MAS)State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Second Edition (MMPI-2)Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory, Third Edition (MCMI-III)Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic (MBMD)Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition (ABAS-II)BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS: His wife arrived unaccompanied and on time for his appointment. He was well-dressed and groomed and appeared younger than his stated age. He ambulated independently and no gross psychomotor abnormalities were apparent. Eye contact was good. Speech was normal with respects to rate, rhythm, and paucity. Receptive language abilities appeared to be good as he was able to appropriately respond to the examiner's questions and instructions. Thought processes were linear and goal-directed and no thought disturbances were noted. Mood appeared to be euthymic. Affect was appropriate and full range.Vision and hearing appeared to be appropriate for the evaluation, although as noted, he apparently has some mild decline in his hearing that has not been addressed or evaluated. Overall, he was very friendly and rapport was very easily developed.He appeared to put full effort into all tasks and thus these results are thought to be an accurate reflection of his current cognitive functioning. Premorbid intellectual functioning; based on a word reading test, premorbid intellectual functioning was estimated to fall in the superior range. He was notably impulse throughout the evaluation, as he would often try to begin a task before the examiner had completed providing instructions.COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING: The patient was performed within the high average range on a measure of gross cognitive functioning assessing his performance across several domains including attention, visuospatial construction, memory conceptualization and initiation or perseveration. He performed within normal limits on all these domains.ATTENTION: Passive and active auditory attention fell in the average range as he was able to accurately repeat six digits in forward sequence and five digits in backward sequence. Visual working memory was in the high average range. On a test of sustained attention for visual stimuli, he demonstrated high rate of accuracy despite the fact that there was mild decreases in consistency of his responses as the task progressed and at different interstimulus intervals. Overall, however, these results appear to be well within normal limits. Thus taken together the patient's auditory and nonverbal attentional abilities, all fell within normal limits and did not suggest significant decline from premorbid levels.LANGUAGE: Confrontation naming was strong and in the high average range. He demonstrated good comprehension for verbal instructions. He made a few very mild errors on a sentence repetition task, which may have been due to mild hearing problems. The errors did not appear to be of clinical significance. Rapid verbal retrieval fell in the average range for both phonemic and semantic cues well within broad normal limits. This result may have represented a mild weakness relative to his estimated premorbid functioning. Thus taken together, language abilities generally fell within the expected range, although mild weaknesses were seen in verbal fluency.VISUOSPATIAL PERCEPTION AND CONSTRUCTION: Visuospatial perception appeared to be within broad normal limits, although his construction and copy of visual figures was quite sloppy and imprecise.LEARNING & MEMORY SKILLS:VERBAL LEARNING AND MEMORY: On a contextual memory task (i.e. stories), the patient performed within the average range immediately following story presentation, as well as following a delay. His recognition of story details was in the low average range. When given a large amount of seemingly unorganized information (i.e. 16-item list), The patient's initial ability to recall five-items immediately following presentation was in the average range. He benefited significantly from repetition as he was able to recall 10 items following the second presentation and following a fifth presentation, he was able to successfully recall 13 of the 16 items (superior). When immediately provided with a second list of 16-items, he was only able to recall three items immediately following presentation (low average). His recall of the first list following short and long delays was in the average range. Delayed recognition was also average.Of note, during his recalls, he made a large number of repetition errors suggesting some difficulty with self-monitoring of his responses. He also did not recognize and apply any organizational strategy. Taken together, The patient's performance across measures of verbal learning and memory fell within broad normal limits relative to others of same age. However, given his very high level of premorbid functioning, his performance suggested some mild weaknesses in encoding and retrieval that he is generally able to overcome with repetition of information.He also appeared to have some difficulty organizing and monitoring his responses and difficulty with learning multiple simultaneous streams of information.NON-VERBAL LEARNING AND MEMORY: The patient's immediate recall of visual designs was in the borderline range. However, he retained most of the information that he initially learned following a delay and his performance fell in the low average range. Recognition was average. Taken together, these results again suggest that he had difficulties with encoding and retrieval of nonverbal information. However, he was able to retain most of the reduced amount of information that he had initially learned.EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING: As mentioned, initiation and verbal fluency fell in the average range. It is mildly weaker than expected given The patient's strong premorbid functioning. He was also noted to make a number of repetition errors on this task. Cognitive set shifting was generally within expected limits and in the average to high average range. He was able to successfully inhibit a prepotent response. On a task assessing cognitive flexibility inductive reasoning and the ability to use feedback in order to correct an ongoing response, The patient was noted to be quite impulsive and had difficulty conceptualizing alternate means to apply strategies in order to determine the correct answer and appeared to be somewhat distracted by nonessential information. As mentioned above, he had a number of repetitions and difficulty organizing information meaningfully on memory tasks. Taken together, these results suggest mild weaknesses in aspects of frontal lobe functioning.MOTOR FUNCTIONING: The patient performed in the average range with both of his right dominant hand and left nondominant hand on a speeded fine motor coordination task.EMOTIONAL FUNCTIONING: On an affective screening measure, the patient endorsed only four items, which suggested that he was bothered by thoughts he could not get out of his head, often felt helpless, felt downhearted and blue and that his mind was not as clear as it used to be. Overall, these results fell within normal limits and suggest that he is not currently experiencing a clinical level of depressive symptoms.SUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS: The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation due to possible changes in memory. He has a history of two episodes of confusion and amnesia, the most recent of which occurred in September 2009 with differential diagnosis including seizure disorder versus transient global amnesia. On this comprehensive evaluation, the patient demonstrated mild weaknesses relative to his very high level of premorbid functioning on tasks assessing memory and executive functioning."
416,Neurology,"PROBLEMS AND ISSUES:1. Headaches, nausea, and dizziness, consistent with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine, recommend amitriptyline for prophylactic treatment and Motrin for abortive treatment.2. Some degree of peripheral neuropathy, consistent with diabetic neuropathy, encouraged her to watch her diet and exercise daily.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient comes in for a neurology consultation regarding her difficult headaches, tunnel vision, and dizziness. I obtained and documented a full history and physical examination. I reviewed the new patient questionnaire, which she completed prior to her arrival today. I also reviewed the results of tests, which she had brought with her.Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25. She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent. They were pulsating. She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms. After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches. In 2004, her headaches returned. She also noted that she had ""zig-zag lines"" in her vision. Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions. She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness. On one occasion she almost had a syncope. Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her. The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week. They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Her past medical history is significant for injury to her left shoulder, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, diabetes, anxiety, and osteoporosis.MEDICATIONS: Her medications include hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, glipizide, metformin, vitamin D, Centrum multivitamin tablets, Actos, lorazepam as needed, Vytorin, and Celexa.ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies.FAMILY HISTORY: There is family history of migraine and diabetes in her siblings.SOCIAL HISTORY: She drinks alcohol occasionally.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Her review of systems was significant for headaches, pain in her left shoulder, sleeping problems and gastroesophageal reflex symptoms. Remainder of her full 14-point review of system was unremarkable.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, the patient was pleasant. She was able to speak English fairly well. Her blood pressure was 130/84. Heart rate was 80. Respiratory rate was 16. Her weight was 188 pounds. Her pain score was 0/10. Her general exam was completely unremarkable. Her neurological examination showed subtle weakness in her left arm due to discomfort and pain. She had reduced vibration sensation in her left ankle and to some degree in her right foot. There was no ataxia. She was able to walk normally. Reflexes were 2+ throughout.She had had a CT scan with constant, which per Dr. X's was unremarkable. She reports that she had a brain MRI two years ago which was also unremarkable.IMPRESSION AND PLAN: The patient is a delightful 60-year-old chemist from Ukraine who has had episodes of headaches with nausea, photophobia, and dizziness since her 20s. She has had some immigration problems in recent months and has experienced increased frequency of her migraine symptoms. Her diagnosis is consistent with vestibular migraine. I do not see evidence of multiple sclerosis, Ménière's disease, or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.I talked to her in detail about the importance of following a migraine diet. I gave her instructions including a list of foods times, which worsen migraine. I reviewed this information for more than half the clinic visit. I would like to start her on amitriptyline at a dose of 10 mg at time. She will take Motrin at a dose of 800 mg as needed for her severe headaches.She will make a diary of her migraine symptoms so that we can find any triggering food items, which worsen her symptoms. I encouraged her to walk daily in order to improve her fitness, which helps to reduce migraine symptoms."
417,Neurology,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: New-onset seizure.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 2-1/2-year-old female with a history of known febrile seizures, who was placed on Keppra oral solution at 150 mg b.i.d. to help prevent febrile seizures. Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone. The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time. Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted. There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Born at 36 weeks' gestation by C-section delivery at 8 pounds 3 ounces. She does have a history of febrile seizures and what parents reported an abdominal migraine, but on further questioning, it appears to be more of a food intolerance issue.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She has undergone no surgical procedures.FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: There is a strong history of epilepsy on the maternal side of family including mom with some nonconvulsive seizure during childhood and additional seizures in maternal great grandmother and a maternal great aunt. There is no other significant neurological history on the paternal side of the family.SOCIAL HISTORY: Currently lives with her mom, dad, and two siblings. She is at home full time and does not attend day care.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Clear review of 10 systems are taken and revealed no additional findings other than those mentioned in the history of present illness.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Vital Signs: Weight was 15.6 kg. She was afebrile. Remainder of her vital signs were stable and within normal ranges for her age as per the medical record.General: She was awake, alert, and oriented. She was in no acute distress, only slightly flustered when trying to place the EEG leads.HEENT: Showed normocephalic and atraumatic head. Her conjunctivae were nonicteric and sclerae were clear. Her eye movements were conjugate in nature. Her tongue and mucous membranes were moist.Neck: Trachea appeared to be in the midline.Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.Cardiovascular: Showed a normal sinus rhythm without murmur.Abdomen: Showed soft, nontender, and nondistended, with good bowel sounds. There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other masses noted on examination.Extremities: Showed IV placement in the right upper extremity with appropriate restraints from the IV. There was no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema throughout. She had no functional deformities in any of her peripheral limbs.Neurological: From neurological standpoint, her cranial nerves were grossly intact throughout. Her strength was good in the bilateral upper and lower extremities without any distal to proximal variation. Her overall resting tone was normal. Sensory examination was grossly intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities. Reflexes were 1+ in bilateral patella. Toes were downgoing bilaterally. Coordination showed accurate striking ability and good rapid alternating movements. Gait examination was deferred at this time due to EEG lead placement.ASSESSMENT: A 2-1/2-year-old female with history of febrile seizures, now with concern for spells of unclear etiology, but somewhat concerning for partial complex seizures and to a slightly lesser extent nonconvulsive generalized seizures.RECOMMENDATIONS1. For now, we will go ahead and try to capture EEG as long as she tolerates it; however, if she would require sedation, I would defer the EEG until further adjustments to seizure medications are made and we will see her response to these medications.2. As per the above, I will increase her Keppra to 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. bringing her to a total daily dose of just under 40 mg/kg per day. If further spells are noted, we may increase upwards again to around 4.5 to 5 mL each day.3. I do not feel like any specific imaging needs to be done at this time until we see her response to the medication and review her EEG findings. EEG, hopefully, will be able to be reviewed first thing tomorrow morning; however, I would not delay discharge the patient to wait on the EEG results. The patient has been discharged and we will contact the family as an outpatient.4. The patient will need followup arrangement with me in 5 to 6 weeks' time, so we may recheck and see how she is doing and arrange for further followup then."
418,Neurology,"CC: Bilateral lower extremity numbness.HX: 21 y/o RHM complained of gradual onset numbness and incoordination of both lower extremities beginning approximately 11/5/96. The symptoms became maximal over a 12-24 hour period and have not changed since. The symptoms consist of tingling in the distal lower extremities approximately half way up the calf bilaterally. He noted decreased coordination of both lower extremities which he thought might be due to uncertainty as to where his feet were being placed in space. He denied bowel/bladder problems, or weakness or numbness elsewhere. Hot showers may improve his symptoms. He has suffered no recent flu-like illness. Past medical and family histories are unremarkable. He was on no medications.EXAM: Unremarkable except for mild distal vibratory sensation loss in the toes (R>L).LAB: CBC, Gen Screen, TSH, FT4, SPE, ANA were all WNL.MRI L-SPINE: Normal.COURSE: Normal exam and diminished symptoms at following visit 4/23/93."
419,Neurology,"REASON FOR CONSULT: Organic brain syndrome in the setting of multiple myeloma.SOURCE OF HISTORY: The patient himself is not able to give a good history. History has obtained through discussion with Dr. X over the phone and the nurse taking care of the patient despite reviewing the chart on the floor.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 56-year-old male with the history of multiple myeloma, who has been admitted for complains of being dehydrated and was doing good until this morning, was found to be disoriented and confused, was not able to communicate properly, and having difficulty leaving out the words. Not a very clear history at this time and the patient himself is not able to give any history despite no family member was present in the room. Neurology consult was called to evaluate any organic brain syndrome in the setting of multiple myeloma. The patient since the morning has improved, but still not completely back to the baseline. Even I evaluated the patient previously, hence not very sure about his baseline.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: History of IgG subtype multiple myeloma.SURGICAL HISTORY: Nothing significant.PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: Nothing significant.SOCIAL HISTORY: No history of any smoking, alcohol or drug abuse.ALLERGIES: CODEINE AND FLAGYL.IMMUNIZATION HISTORY: Nothing significant.FAMILY HISTORY: Unobtainable.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient was considered to ask question for systemic review including neurology, psychiatry, sleep, ENT, ophthalmology, pulmonary, cardiology, gastroenterology, genitourinary, hematology, rheumatology, dermatology, allergy/immunology, endocrinology, toxicology, oncology, and found to be positive for the symptoms mentioned in the history of the presenting illness. The patient himself is not able to give any history only source is the chart. For details, please review the chart.PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONVITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure of 97/54, heart rate of 97, respiratory rate of 19, and temperature 98.5. The patient on supplemental oxygen was FiO2 on 2 L 96%. Limited physical examination.HEENT: Head, normocephalic and atraumatic. Throat clear. No discharge from the ear and the nose. No discoloration of conjunctivae and the sclerae.NECK: Supple. No signs of any meningismus.

No bruit auscultated over the neck and the orbits.LUNGS: Clear to auscultation.HEART: Normal heart sounds.ABDOMEN: Benign.EXTREMITIES: No edema, clubbing or cyanosis. No rash. No leptomeningeal or neurocutaneous disorder.NEUROLOGIC: Examination is limited. Mental state examination, the patient is awake, alert, and oriented to himself, not able follow commands, and give a proper history, and still appeared to be confuse and disoriented. Cranial nerve examination limited, but apparently nonfocal. Motor examination is very limited except for the grips, which were strong enough. I was not able to obtain much. Deep tendon reflexes were not reliable. Toes equivocal and downgoing. Sensory examination is not reliable, though intact for painful stimuli with limited examination. Coordination could not be tested. Gait could not be tested.IMPRESSION: History of multiple myeloma and altered mental status in multiple myeloma setting. Rule out brain metastasis including lepto-meningismus, possible transient ischemic attack related to hyperviscosity syndrome or provoked seizure related to ischemia, and delirium related to any electrolyte imbalance or underlying infarction.PLAN AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The patient is to continue with current level of management. I will review the chart before ordering any further testing that may include a CT scan of the brain, if has not been ordered, EEG, urine test, and the latest CBC with diff. to rule out any urinary tract infection or indication of any other seen of infection. No other intervention at this time. The patient may be started on aspirin, if it is okay with Dr. X."

423,Neurology,"DIAGNOSIS: Status post brain tumor removal.HISTORY: The patient is a 64-year-old female referred to physical therapy following complications related to brain tumor removal. The patient reports that on 10/24/08 she had a brain tumor removed and had left-sided weakness. The patient was being seen in physical therapy from 11/05/08 to 11/14/08 then she began having complications. The patient reports that she was admitted to Hospital on 12/05/08. At that time, they found massive swelling on the brain and a second surgery was performed. The patient then remained in acute rehab until she was discharged to home on 01/05/09. The patient's husband, Al, is also present and he reports that during rehabilitation the patient did have a DVT in the left calf that has since been resolved.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Unremarkable.MEDICATIONS: Coumadin, Keppra, Decadron, and Glucophage.SUBJECTIVE: The patient reports that the pain is not an issue at this time. The patient states that her primary concern is her left-sided weakness as related to her balance and her walking and her left arm weakness.PATIENT GOAL: To increase strength in her left leg for better balance and walking.OBJECTIVE:RANGE OF MOTION: Bilateral lower extremities are within normal limits.STRENGTH: Bilateral lower extremities are grossly 5/5 with one repetition, except left hip reflexion 4+/5.BALANCE: The patient's balance was assessed with a Berg balance test. The patient has got 46/56 points, which places her at moderate risk for falls.GAIT: The patient ambulates with contact guard assist. The patient ambulates with a reciprocal gait pattern with good bilateral foot clearance. However, the patient has been reports that with increased fatigue, left footdrop tends to occur. A 6-minute walk test will be performed at the next visit due to time constraints.ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 64-year-old female referred to Physical Therapy status post brain surgery. Examination indicates deficits in strength, balance, and ambulation. The patient will benefit from skilled physical therapy to address these impairments.TREATMENT PLAN: The patient will be seen three times per week for 4 weeks and then reduce it to two times per week for 4 additional weeks. Interventions include:1. Therapeutic exercise.2. Balance training.3. Gait training.4. Functional mobility training.SHORT TERM GOAL TO BE COMPLETED IN 4 WEEKS:1. The patient is to tolerate 30 repetitions of all lower extremity exercises.2. The patient is to improve balance with a score of 50/56 points.3. The patient is to ambulate 1000 feet in a 6-minute walk test with standby assist.LONG TERM GOAL TO BE ACHIEVED IN 8 WEEKS:1. The patient is to ambulate independently within her home and standby to general supervision within the community.2. Berg balance test to be 52/56.3. The patient is to ambulate a 6-minute walk test for 1500 feet independently including safe negotiation of corners and busy areas.4. The patient is to demonstrate safely stepping over and around objects without loss of balance.Prognosis for the above-stated goals is good. The above treatment plan has been discussed with the patient and her husband. They are in agreement."
424,Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma.OPERATION PERFORMED: Endoscopic-assisted transsphenoidal exploration and radical excision of pituitary adenoma, endoscopic exposure of sphenoid sinus with removal of tissue from within the sinus, harvesting of dermal fascia abdominal fat graft, placement of abdominal fat graft into sella turcica, reconstruction of sellar floor using autologous nasal bone creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm, repair of nasal septal deviation, using the operating microscope and microdissection technique, and placement of lumbar subarachnoid catheter connected to reservoir for aspiration and infusion.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This man has undergone one craniotomy and 2 previous transsphenoidal resections of his tumor, which is known to be an invasive pituitary adenoma. He did not return for followup or radiotherapy as instructed, and the tumor has regrown. For this reason, he is admitted for transsphenoidal reoperation with an attempt to remove as much tumor as possible. The high-risk nature of the procedure and the fact that postoperative radiation is mandatory was made clear to him. Many risks including CSF leak and blindness were discussed in detail. After clear understanding of all the same, he elected to proceed ahead with surgery.PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on the operating table, and after adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately. The back was prepped and draped in usual sterile manner.A 14-gauge Tuohy needle was introduced into the lumbar subarachnoid space. Clear and colorless CSF issued forth. A catheter was inserted to a distance of 40 cm, and the needle was removed. The catheter was then connected to a closed drainage system for aspiration and infusion.This no-touch technique is now a standard of care for treatment of patients with large invasive adenomas. Via injections through the lumbar drain, one increases intracranial pressure and produces gentle migration of the tumor. This improves outcome and reduces complications by atraumatically dissecting the tumor away from the optic apparatus.The patient was then placed supine, and the 3-point headrest was affixed. He was placed in the semi-sitting position with the head turned to the right and a roll placed under the left shoulder. Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately. The fluoroscope C-arm unit was then positioned so as to afford an excellent view of the sella and sphenoid sinus in the lateral projection. The metallic arm was then connected to the table for the use of the endoscope. The oropharynx, nasopharynx, and abdominal areas were then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.A transverse incision was made in the abdominal region, and several large pieces of fat were harvested for later use. Hemostasis was obtained. The wound was carefully closed in layers.I then advanced a 0-degree endoscope up the left nostril. The middle turbinate was identified and reflected laterally exposing the sphenoid sinus ostium. Needle Bovie electrocautery was used to clear mucosa away from the ostium. The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid had already been separated from the sphenoid. I entered into the sphenoid.There was a tremendous amount of dense fibrous scar tissue present, and I slowly and carefully worked through all this. I identified a previous sellar opening and widely opened the bone, which had largely regrown out to the cavernous sinus laterally on the left, which was very well exposed, and the cavernous sinus on the right, which I exposed the very medial portion of. The opening was wide until I had the horizontal portion of the floor to the tuberculum sella present.The operating microscope was then utilized. Working under magnification, I used hypophysectomy placed in the nostril.The dura was then carefully opened in the midline, and I immediately encountered tissue consistent with pituitary adenoma. A frozen section was obtained, which confirmed this diagnosis without malignant features.Slowly and meticulously, I worked to remove the tumor. I used the suction apparatus as well as the bipolar coagulating forceps and ring and cup curette to begin to dissect tumor free. The tumor was moderately vascular and very fibrotic.Slowly and carefully, I systematically entered the sellar contents until I could see the cavernous sinus wall on the left and on the right. There appeared to be cavernous sinus invasion on the left. It was consistent with what we saw on the MRI imaging.The portion working into the suprasellar cistern was slowly dissected down by injecting saline into the lumbar subarachnoid catheter. A large amount of this was removed. There was a CSF leak, as the tumor was removed for the upper surface of it was very adherent to the arachnoid and could not be separated free.Under high magnification, I actually worked up into this cavity and performed a very radical excision of tumor. While there may be a small amount of tumor remaining, it appeared that a radical excision had been created with decompression of the optic apparatus. In fact, I reinserted the endoscope and could see the optic chiasm well.I reasoned that I had therefore achieved the goal with that is of a radical excision and decompression. Attention was therefore turned to closure.The wound was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution, and meticulous hemostasis was obtained. I asked Anesthesiology to perform a Valsalva maneuver, and there was no evidence of bleeding.Attention was turned to closure and reconstruction. I placed a very large piece of fat in the sella to seal the leak and verified that there was no fat in the suprasellar cistern by using fluoroscopy and looking at the pattern of the air. Using a polypropylene insert, I reconstructed the sellar floor with this implant making a nice tight sling and creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm.DuraSeal was placed over this, and the sphenoid sinus was carefully packed with fat and DuraSeal.I inspected the nasal passages and restored the septum precisely to the midline repairing a previous septal deviation. The middle turbinates were then restored to their anatomic position. There was no significant intranasal bleeding, and for this reason, an open nasal packing was required. Sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated.The patient tolerated the procedure well and left to the recovery room in excellent condition. The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct, and there were no intraoperative complications.Specimens were sent to Pathology consisting of tumor."
425,Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: The patient is a 38-year-old woman with pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema who comes in because of new onset of headaches. She comes to clinic by herself.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Dr. X has cared for her since 2002. She has a Codman-Hakim shunt set at 90 mmH2O. She last saw us in clinic in January 2008 and at that time we recommended that she followup with Dr. Y for medical management of her chronic headaches. We also recommended that the patient see a psychiatrist regarding her depression, which she stated that she would followup with that herself. Today, the patient returns to clinic because of acute onset of headaches that she has had since her shunt was adjusted after an MRI on 04/18/08. She states that since that time her headaches have been bad. They woke her up at night. She has not been able to sleep. She has not had a good sleep cycle since that time. She states that the pain is constant and is worse with coughing, straining, and sneezing as well as on standing up. She states that they feel a little bit better when lying down. Medication shave not helped her. She has tried taking Imitrex as well as Motrin 800 mg twice a day, but she states it has not provided much relief. The pain is generalized, but also noted to be quite intense in the frontal region of her head. She also reports ringing in the ears and states that she just does not feel well. She reports no nausea at this time. She also states that she has been experiencing intermittent blurry vision and dimming lights as well. She tells me that she has an appointment with Dr. Y tomorrow. She reports no other complaints at this time.MAJOR FINDINGS: On examination today, this is a pleasant 38-year-old woman who comes back from the clinic waiting area without difficulty. She is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.Vital Signs: Blood pressure 153/86, pulse 63, and respiratory rate 16.Cranial Nerves: Intact for extraocular movements. Facial movement, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movements are all intact. I did not know any papilledema on exam bilaterally.I examined her shut site, which is clean, dry, and intact. She did have a small 3 mm to 4 mm round scab, which was noted farther down from her shunt reservoir. It looks like there is a little bit of dry blood there.ASSESSMENT: The patient appears to have had worsening headaches since shunt adjustment back after an MRI.PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:1. Pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema.2. Migraine headaches.PROCEDURES: I programmed her shunt to 90 mmH2O.PLAN: It was noted that the patient began to have an acute onset of headache pain after her shunt adjustment approximately a week and a half ago. I had programmed her shunt back to 90 mmH2O at that time and confirmed it with an x-ray. However, the picture of the x-ray was not the most desirable picture. Thus, I decided to reprogram the shunt back to 90 mmH2O today and have the patient return to Sinai for a skull x-ray to confirm the setting at 90. In addition, she told me that she is scheduled to see Dr. Y tomorrow, so she should followup with him and also plan on contacting the Wilmer Eye Institute to setup an appointment. She should followup with the Wilmer Eye Institute as she is complaining of blurry vision and dimming of the lights occasionally.Total visit time was approximately 60 minutes and about 10 minutes of that time was spent in counseling the patient."

427,Neurology,"Doctor's NameDoctor's AddressDear Doctor:This letter serves as a reintroduction of my patient, A, who will be seeing you on Thursday, 06/12/2008. As you know, he is an unfortunate gentleman who has reflex sympathetic dystrophy of both lower extremities. His current symptoms are more severe on the right and he has had a persisting wound that has failed to heal on his right leg. He has been through Wound Clinic to try to help heal this, but was intolerant of compression dressings and was unable to get satisfactory healing of this. He has been seen by Dr. X for his pain management and was considered for the possibility of amputation being a therapeutic option to help reduce his pain. He was seen by Dr. Y at Orthopedic Associates for review of this. However, in my discussion with Dr. Z and his evaluation of Mr. A, it was felt that this may be an imprudent path to take given the lack of likelihood of reduction of his pain from his RST, his questionable healing of his wound given noninvasive studies that did reveal tenuous oxygenation of the right lower leg, and concerns of worsening of his RST symptoms on his left leg if he would have an amputation. Based on the results of his transcutaneous oxygen levels and his dramatic improvement with oxygen therapy at this test, Dr. Z felt that a course of hyperbaric oxygen may be of utility to help in improving his wounds. As you may or may not know we have certainly pursued aggressive significant measures to try to improve Mr. A's pain. He has been to Cleveland Clinic for implantable stimulator, which was unsuccessful at dramatically improving his pain. He currently is taking methadone up to eight tablets four times a day, morphine up to 100 mg three times a day, and Dilaudid two tablets by mouth every two hours to help reduce his pain. He also is currently taking Neurontin 1600 mg three times a day, Effexor XR 250 mg once a day, Cytomel 25 mcg once a day, Seroquel 100 mg p.o. q. day, levothyroxine 300 mcg p.o. q. day, Prinivil 20 mg p.o. q. day, and Mevacor 40 mg p.o. q day.I appreciate your assistance in determining if hyperbaric oxygen is a reasonable treatment course for this unfortunate situation. Dr. Z and I have both tried to stress the fact that amputation may be an abrupt and irreversible treatment course that may not reach any significant conclusion. He has been evaluated by Dr. X for rehab concerns to determine. He agrees that a less aggressive form of therapy may be most appropriate.I thank you kindly for your prompt evaluation of this kind gentleman in an unfortunate situation. If you have any questions regarding his care please feel free to call me at my office. Otherwise, I look forward to hearing back from you shortly after your evaluation. Please feel free to call me if it is possible or if you have any questions about anything."
428,Neurology,"X Y, MDCity, StateDear Dr. Y:I had the pleasure of seeing ABC today back in Neurology Clinic where he has been followed previously by Dr. Z. His last visit was in June 2006, and he carries a diagnosis of benign rolandic epilepsy. To review, his birth was unremarkable. He is a second child born to a G3, P1 to 2 female. He has had normal development, and is a bright child in 7th grade. He began having seizures, however, at 9 years of age. It is manifested typically as generalized tonic-clonic seizures upon awakening or falling into sleep. He also had smaller spells with more focal convulsion and facial twitching. His EEGs have shown a pattern consistent with benign rolandic epilepsy (central temporal sharp waves both of the right and left hemisphere). Most recent EEG in May 2006 shows the same abnormalities.ABC initially was placed on Tegretol, but developed symptoms of toxicity (hallucinations) on this medication, he was switched to Trileptal. He has done very well taking 300 mg twice a day without any further seizures. His last event was the day of his last EEG when he was sleep deprived and was off medication. That was a convulsion lasting 5 minutes. He has done well otherwise. Parents deny that he has any problems with concentration. He has not had any behavior issues. He is an active child and participates in sports and some motocross activities. He has one older sibling and he lives with his parents. Father manages Turkey farm with foster farms. Mother is an 8th grade teacher.Family history is positive for a 3rd cousin, who has seizures, but the specific seizure type is not known. There is no other relevant family history.Review of systems is positive for right heel swelling and tenderness to palpation. This is perhaps due to sports injury. He has not sprained his ankle and does not have any specific acute injury around the time that this was noted. He does also have some discomfort in the knees and ankles in the general sense with activities. He has no rashes or any numbness, weakness or loss of skills. He has no respiratory or cardiovascular complaints. He has no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal complaints.Past medical history is otherwise unremarkable.Other workup includes CT scan and MRI scan of the brain, which are both normal.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: The patient is a well-nourished, well-hydrated male in no acute distress. VITAL SIGNS: His weight today is 80.6 pounds. Height is 58-1/4 inches. Blood pressure 113/66. Head circumference 36.3 cm. HEENT: Atraumatic, normocephalic. Oropharynx shows no lesions. NECK: Supple without adenopathy. CHEST: Clear auscultation.CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. ABDOMEN: Benign without organomegaly. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema. NEUROLOGIC: The patient is alert and oriented. His cognitive skills appear normal for his age. His speech is fluent and goal-directed. He follows instructions well. His cranial nerves reveal his pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. Visual fields are full. Disks are sharp bilaterally. Face moves symmetrically with normal sensation. Palate elevates midline. Tongue protrudes midline. Hearing is intact bilaterally. Motor exam reveals normal strength and tone. Sensation intact to light touch and vibration. His gait is nonataxic with normal heel-toe and tandem. Finger-to-nose, finger-nose-finger, rapid altering movements are normal. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric.IMPRESSION: This is an 11-year-old male with benign rolandic epilepsy, who is followed over the past 2 years in our clinic. Most recent electroencephalogram still shows abnormalities, but it has not been done since May 2006. The plan at this time is to repeat his electroencephalogram, follow his electroencephalogram annually until it reveres to normal. At that time, he will be tapered off of medication. I anticipate at some point in the near future, within about a year or so, he will actually be taken off medication. For now, I will continue on Trileptal 300 mg twice a day, which is a low starting dose for him. There is no indication that his dose needs to be increased. Family understands the plan. We will try to obtain an electroencephalogram in the near future in Modesto and followup is scheduled for 6 months. Parents will contact us after the electroencephalogram is done so they can get the results.Thank you very much for allowing me to access ABC for further management."
429,Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: Followup left-sided rotator cuff tear and cervical spinal stenosis.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her left shoulder pain and left upper extremity C6 radiculopathy. I had last seen her on 06/21/07.At that time, she had been referred to me Dr. X and Dr. Y for evaluation of her left-sided C6 radiculopathy. She also had a significant rotator cuff tear and is currently being evaluated for left-sided rotator cuff repair surgery, I believe on, approximately 07/20/07. At our last visit, I only had a report of her prior cervical spine MRI. I did not have any recent images. I referred her for cervical spine MRI and she returns today.She states that her symptoms are unchanged. She continues to have significant left-sided shoulder pain for which she is being evaluated and is scheduled for surgery with Dr. Y.She also has a second component of pain, which radiates down the left arm in a C6 distribution to the level of the wrist. She has some associated minimal weakness described in detail in our prior office note. No significant right upper extremity symptoms. No bowel, bladder dysfunction. No difficulty with ambulation.FINDINGS: On examination, she has 4 plus over 5 strength in the left biceps and triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 left deltoid, 5 out of 5 otherwise in both muscle groups and all muscle groups of upper extremities. Light touch sensation is minimally decreased in the left C6 distribution; otherwise, intact. Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 1 plus. Hoffmann sign normal bilaterally. Motor strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups in lower extremities. Hawkins and Neer impingement signs are positive at the left shoulder.An EMG study performed on 06/08/07 demonstrates no evidence of radiculopathy or plexopathy or nerve entrapment to the left upper extremity.Cervical spine MRI dated 06/28/07 is reviewed. It is relatively limited study due to artifact. He does demonstrate evidence of minimal-to-moderate stenosis at the C5-C6 level but without evidence of cord impingement or cord signal change. There appears to be left paracentral disc herniation at the C5-C6 level, although axial T2-weighted images are quite limited.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. ABC's history, physical examination and radiographic findings are compatible with left shoulder pain and left upper extremity pain, which is due to a combination of left-sided rotator cuff tear and moderate cervical spinal stenosis.I agree with the plan to go ahead and continue with rotator cuff surgery. With regard to the radiculopathy, I believe this can be treated non-operatively to begin with. I am referring her for consideration of cervical epidural steroid injections. The improvement in her pain may help her recover better from the shoulder surgery.I will see her back in followup in 3 months, at which time she will be recovering from a shoulder surgery and we will see if she needs any further intervention with regard to the cervical spine.I will also be in touch with Dr. Y to let him know this information prior to the surgery in several weeks."
430,Neurology,"CC: Headache.HX: This 51 y/o RHM was moving furniture several days prior to presentation when he struck his head (vertex) against a door panel. He then stepped back and struck his back on a trailer hitch. There was no associated LOC but he felt ""dazed."" He complained a HA since the accident. The following day he began experiencing episodic vertigo lasting several minutes with associated nausea and vomiting. He has been lying in bed most of the time since the accident. He also complained of transient left lower extremity weakness. The night before admission he went to his bedroom and his girlfriend heard a loud noise. She found him on the floor unable to speak or move his left side well. He was taken to a local ER. In the ER experienced a spell in which he stared to the right for approximately one minute. During this time he was unable to speak and did not seem to comprehend verbal questions. This resolved. ER staff noted decreased left sided movement and a left Babinski sign.He was given valium 5 mg, and DPH 1.0g. A HCT was performed and he was transferred to UIHC.PMH: DM, Coronary Artery Disease, Left femoral neuropathy of unknown etiology. Multiple head trauma in past (?falls/fights).MEDS: unknown oral med for DM.SHX: 10+pack-year h/o Tobacco use; quit 2 years ago. 6-pack beer/week. No h/o illicit drug use.FHX: unknown.EXAM: 70BPM, BP144/83, 16RPM, 36.0CMS: Alert and oriented to person, place, time. Fluent speech.CN: left lower facial weakness with right gaze preference. Pupils 3/3 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Optic disks flat.MOTOR: decreased spontaneous movement of left-sided extremities. 5/4 strength in both upper and lower extremities. Normal muscle tone and bulk.SENSORY: withdrew equally to noxious stimulation in all four extremities. GAIT/STATION/COORDINATION: not tested.The general physical exam was unremarkable.During the exam the patient experienced a spell during which his head turned and eyes deviated to the leftward, and his right hand twitched. The entire spell lasted one minute.During the episode he was verbally unresponsive. He appeared groggy and lethargic after the event.HCT without contrast: 11/18/92: right frontal skull fracture with associated minimal epidural hematoma and small subdural hematoma, as well as some adjacent subarachnoid blood and brain contusion.LABS: CBC, GS, PT/PTT were all WNL.COURSE: The patient was diagnosed with a right frontal SAH/contusion and post traumatic seizures. DPH was continued and he was given a Librium taper for possible alcoholic withdrawal. A neurosurgical consult was obtained. He did not receive surgical intervention and was discharged 12/1/92. Neuropsychological testing on 11/25/92 revealed: poor orientation to time or place and poor attention. Anterograde verbal and visual memory was severely impaired. Speech became mildly dysarthric when fatigued. Defective word finding. Difficulty copying 2 of 3 three dimensional figures. Recent head injury as well as a history of ETOH abuse and multiple prior head injuries probably contribute to his deficits."
431,Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.PROCEDURE: Right temporal bone resection; rectus abdominis myocutaneous free flap for reconstruction of skull base defect; right selective neck dissection zones 2 and 3.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought into the operating room, placed on the table in supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained in the usual fashion. The Neurosurgery team placed the patient in pins and after they positioned the patient the right lateral scalp was prepped with Betadine after shave as well as the abdomen. The neck was prepped as well. After this was performed, I made a wide ellipse of the conchal bowl with the Bovie and cutting current down through the cartilage of the conchal bowl. A wide postauricular incision well beyond the mastoid tip extending into the right neck was then incised with the Bovie with the cutting current and a postauricular skin flap developed leaving the excise conchal bowl in place as the auricle was reflected over anterior to the condyle. After this was performed, I used the Bovie to incise the soft tissue around the temporal bone away from the tumor on to the mandible. The condyle was skeletonized so that it could be easily seen. The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was dissected out and the spinal accessory nerve was identified and spared. The neck contents to the hyoid were dissected out. The hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, and spinal accessory nerve were dissected towards the jugular foramen. The neck contents were removed as a separate specimen. The external carotid artery was identified and tied off as it entered the parotid and tied with a Hemoclip distally for the future anastomosis. A large posterior facial vein was identified and likewise clipped for later use. I then used the cutting and diamond burs to incise the skull above the external auditory canal so as to expose the dura underneath this and extended it posteriorly to the sigmoid sinus, dissecting or exposing the dura to the level of the jugular bulb. It became evident there was two tumor extending down the eustachian tube medial to the condyle and therefore I did use the router, I mean the side cutting bur to resect the condyle and the glenoid fossa to expose the medial extent of the eustachian tube. The internal carotid artery was dissected out of the parapharyngeal space into the carotid canal and I drilled carotid canal up until it made. I dissected the vertical segment of the carotid out as it entered the temporal bone until it made us turn to the horizontal portion. Once this was dissected out, Dr. X entered the procedure for completion of the resection with the craniotomy. For details, please see his operative note.After Dr. X had completed the resection, I then harvested the rectus free flap. A skin paddle was drawn out next to the umbilicus about 4 x 4 cm. The skin paddle was incised with the Bovie and down to the anterior rectus sheath. Sagittal incisions were made up superiorly and inferiorly to the skin paddle and the anterior rectus sheath dissected out above and below the skin paddle. The sheath was incised to the midline and a small ellipse was made around the fascia to provide blood supply to the overlying skin. The skin paddle was then sutured to the fascia and muscle with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl. The anterior rectus sheath was then reflected off the rectus muscle, which was then divided superiorly with the Bovie and reflected out of the rectus sheath to an inferior direction. The vascular pedicle could be seen entering the muscle in usual fashion. The muscle was divided inferior to the pedicle and then the pedicle was dissected to the groin to the external iliac artery and vein where it was ligated with two large Hemoclips on each vessel. The wound was then packed with saline impregnated sponges. The rectus muscle with attached skin paddle was then transferred into the neck. The inferior epigastric artery was sutured to the end of the external carotid with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon with standard microvascular technique. Ischemia time was less than 10 minutes. Likewise, the inferior epigastric vein was sutured to the end of the posterior facial vein with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon as well. There was excellent blood flow through the flap and there were no or any issues with the vascular pedicle throughout the remainder of the case. The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of saline. The eustachian tube was obstructed with bone wax. The muscle was then laid into position with the skin paddle underneath the conchal bowl. I removed most the skin of the conchal bowl de-epithelializing and leaving the fat in place. The wound was closed in layers overlying the muscle, which was secured superiorly to the muscle overlying the temporal skull. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with skin staples. There was small incision made in the postauricular skin where the muscle could be seen and the skin edges were sewn directly to the muscle as to the rectus muscle itself. The skin paddle was closed with interrupted 4-0 Prolene to the edges of the conchal bowl.The abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the rectus sheath was closed with #1 Prolene with the more running suture, taking care to avoid injury to the posterior rectus sheath by the use of ribbon retractors. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with skin staples. The patient was then turned over to the Neurosurgery team for awakening after the patient was appropriately awakened. The patient was then transferred to the PACU in stable condition with spontaneous respirations, having tolerated the procedure well."
432,Neurology,"PROCEDURE: Sleep study.CLINICAL INFORMATION: This patient is a 56-year-old gentleman who had symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea with snoring, hypertension. The test was done 01/24/06. The patient weighed 191 pounds, five feet, seven inches tall.SLEEP QUESTIONNAIRE: According to the patient's own estimate, the patient took about 15 minutes to fall asleep, slept for six and a half hours, did have some dreams. Did not wake up and the sleep was less refreshing. He was sleepy in the morning.STUDY PROTOCOL: An all night polysomnogram was recorded with a Compumedics E Series digital polysomnograph. After the scalp was prepared, Ag/AgCl electrodes were applied to the scalp according to the International 10-20 System. EEG was monitored from C4-A1, C3-A2, O2-A1 and O2-A1. EOG and EMG were continuously monitored by electrodes placed at the outer canthi and chin respectively. Nasal and oral airflow were monitored using a triple port Thermistor. Respiratory effort was measured by piezoelectric technology employing an abdominal and thoracic belt. Blood oxygen saturation was continuously monitored by pulse oximetry. Heart rate and rhythm were monitored by surface electrocardiography. Anterior tibialis EMG was studied by using surface mounted electrodes placed 5 cm apart on both legs. Body position and snoring level were also monitored.TECHNICAL QUALITY OF STUDY: Good.ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC MEASUREMENTS: Total recording time 406 minutes, total sleep time 365 minutes, sleep latency 25.5 minutes, REM latency 49 minutes, _____ 90%, sleep latency measured 86%. _____ period was obtained. The patient spent 10% of the time awake in bed.Stage I: 3.8Stage II: 50.5Stage III: 14%Stage REM: 21.7%The patient had relatively good sleep architecture, except for excessive waking.RESPIRATORY MEASUREMENTS: Total apnea/hypopnea 75, age index 12.3 per hour. REM age index 15 per hour. Total arousal 101, arousal index 15.6 per hour. Oxygen desaturation was down to 88%. Longest event 35 second hypopnea with an FiO2 of 94%. Total limb movements 92, PRM index 15.1 per hour. PRM arousal index 8.9 per hour.ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS: Heart rate while asleep 60 to 64 per minute, while awake 70 to 78 per minute.CONCLUSIONS: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with moderately loud snoring and significant apnea/hypopnea index.RECOMMENDATIONS:AXIS B: Overnight polysomnography.AXIS C: Hypertension.The patient should return for nasal CPAP titration. Sleep apnea if not treated, may lead to chronic hypertension, which may have cardiovascular consequences. Excessive daytime sleepiness, dysfunction and memory loss may also occur."
433,Neurology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Severe back pain and sleepiness.The patient is not a good historian and history was obtained from the patient's husband at bedside.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76-year-old obese Caucasian female with past medical conditions that includes hypertension, history of urinary incontinence, dementia, and chronic back pain, basically brought by the husband to the emergency room because of having excruciating back pain. As per the husband, the patient has this back pain for about almost 1 year and seeing Dr. X in Neurosurgery and had an epidural injection x2, and then the patient's pain somewhat got better between, but last time the patient went to see Dr. X, the patient given injection and the patient passed out, so the doctor stopped giving any other epidural injection. The patient has severe pain and all in all, the patient cries at home. As per the husband, the patient woke up in the morning with severe pain, unable to eat, drink today, and crying in the morning, so brought her to the emergency room for further evaluation. The patient denied any history of fever, cough, chest pain, diarrhea, dysuria or polyuria. While I was examining the patient, the patient explained about possible diagnosis and treatment plan and possible nursing home discharge for pain control. The patient passed out for about 3 to 4 minutes, unable to respond to even painful stimuli. The patient's heart rate went down to 50s and blood pressure was 92 systolic, so the patient was later on given IV fluid and blood pressure checked. The patient woke up after 5 to 6 minutes, so the patient was later on evaluated for admission because of near syncopal episode.PAST MEDICAL CONDITIONS: Include hypertension, dementia, urinary incontinence, chronic back pain, and degenerative joint disease of the spine. No history of diabetes, stroke or coronary artery disease.SURGICAL HISTORY: Include left total hip replacement many years ago, history of hysterectomy, and appendectomy in the young age.ALLERGIES: DENIED.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: According to the list shows the patient takes hydrocodone 10/325 mg every 6 hours, Flexeril 10 mg p.o. at bedtime, and Xanax 0.25 mg p.o. 4 times a day. The patient also takes Neurontin 200 mg 3 times a day, propranolol 10 mg twice a day, oxybutynin 5 mg p.o. twice a day, Namenda 10 mg p.o. daily, and Aricept 10 mg p.o. daily.SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her husband, usually walks with a walker and wheelchair-bound, does not walk much as per the husband knows. No history of alcohol abuse or smoking.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: Currently lying in the bed without apparent distress, very lethargic.VITAL SIGNS: Pulse rate of 55, blood pressure is 92/52, after IV fluid came up to 105/58.CHEST: Shows bilateral air entry present, clear to auscultate.HEART: S1 and S2 regular.ABDOMEN: Soft, nondistended, and nontender.EXTREMITIES: Shows the patient's straight leg raising to be only up to 30% causing the patient severe back pain.IMAGING: The patient's x-ray of the lumbosacral spine done shows there is a L1 compression fracture with some osteophyte formation in the lumbar spine suggestive of degenerative joint disease.LABORATORY DATA: The patient's lab test is not done currently, but previous lab test done in 3/2009 seems to be in acceptable range.IMPRESSION: The patient, because of near syncopal episode and polypharmacy, almost passed out for about 3 to 4 minutes in front of me with a low blood pressure.1. Vasovagal syncope versus polypharmacy because of 3 to 4 medications and muscle relaxants.2. Osteoporosis of the spine with L1 compression fracture causing the patient severe pain.3. Hypertension, now hypotension.4. Incontinence of the bladder.5. Dementia, most likely Alzheimer type.PLAN AND SUGGESTION: Initial plan was to send the patient to the nursing home, but because of the patient's low blood pressure and heart rate low, we will admit the patient to DOU for 23-hour observation, start the patient on IV fluid, normal saline, 20 mEq KCl, and Protonix 40 mg, and we will also continue the patient's Namenda and Aricept. I will hold the patient's hydrocodone. I will hold the Flexeril and I will also hold gabapentin at this moment. We will give the patient's pain control with Percocet and very minimal morphine sulfate as needed. Also give the patient calcium with vitamin D and physical therapy. We will also order a blood test and further management will be based on the patient's all test results. I also explained to the husband that tomorrow if the patient is better and more alert and awake, then we will send her to the nursing care versus home, it depends on the pain control."
434,Neurology,"SUBJECTIVE: This patient presents to the office today because of some problems with her right hand. It has been going tingling and getting numb periodically over several weeks. She just recently moved her keyboard down at work. She is hoping that will help. She is worried about carpal tunnel. She does a lot of repetitive type activities. It is worse at night. If she sleeps on it a certain way, she will wake up and it will be tingling then she can usually shake out the tingling, but nonetheless it is very bothersome for her. It involves mostly the middle finger, although, she says it also involves the first and second digits on the right hand. She has some pain in her thumb as well. She thinks that could be arthritis.OBJECTIVE: Weight 213.2 pounds, blood pressure 142/84, pulse 92, respirations 16. General: The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress. Musculoskeletal: The right hand was examined. It appears to be within normal limits and the appearance is similar to the left hand. She has good and equal grip strength noted bilaterally. She has negative Tinel's bilaterally. She has a positive Phalen's test. The fingers on the right hand are neurovascularly intact with a normal capillary refill.ASSESSMENT: Numbness and tingling in the right upper extremity, intermittent and related to the positioning of the wrist. I suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.PLAN: The patient is going to use Anaprox double strength one pill every 12 hours with food as well as a cock-up wrist splint. We are going to try this for two weeks and if the condition is still present, then we are going to proceed with EMG test at that time. She is going to let me know. While she is here, I am going to also get her the blood test she needs for her diabetes. I am noting that her blood pressure is elevated, but improved from the last visit. I also noticed that she has lost a lot of weight. She is working on diet and exercise and she is doing a great job. Right now for the blood pressure we are going to continue to observe as she carries forward additional measures in her diet and exercise to lose more weight and I expect the blood pressure will continue to improve."
435,Neurology,"SUBJECTIVE: The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male that was last seen in clinic on 07/29/2008 with diagnosis of new onset seizures and an MRI scan, which demonstrated right contrast-enhancing temporal mass. Given the characteristics of this mass and his new onset seizures, it is significantly concerning for a high-grade glioma. OBJECTIVE: The patient is alert and oriented times three, GCS of 15. Cranial nerves II to XII are grossly intact. Motor exam demonstrates 5/5 strength in all four extremities. Sensation is intact to light touch, pain, temperature, and proprioception. Cerebellar exam is intact. Gait is normal and tandem on heels and toes. Speech is appropriate. Judgment is intact. Pupils are equal and reactive to light.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male with a new diagnosis of rim-enhancing right temporal mass. Given the characteristics of the MRI scan, it is highly likely that he demonstrates high-grade glioma and concerning for glioblastoma multiforme. We have discussed in length the possible benefits of biopsy, surgical resection, medical management, as well as chemotherapy, radiation treatments, and doing nothing. Given the high probability that the mass represents a high-grade glioma, the patient, after weighing the risks and the benefits of surgery, has agreed to undergo a surgical biopsy and resection of the mass as well as concomitant chemotherapy and radiation as the diagnosis demonstrates a high-grade glioma. The patient has signed consent for his right temporal craniotomy for biopsy and likely resection of right temporal brain tumor. He agrees that he will be n.p.o. after mid night on Wednesday night. He is sent for preoperative assessment with the Anesthesiology tomorrow morning. He has undergone vocational rehab assessment."
436,Neurology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Status epilepticus.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 6-year-old male who is a former 27-week premature infant who suffered an intraventricular hemorrhage requiring shunt placement, and as a result, has developmental delay and left hemiparesis. At baseline, he can put about 2 to 4 words together in brief sentences. His speech is not always easily understood; however, he is in a special education classroom in kindergarten. He ambulates independently, but falls often. He has difficulty with his left side compared to the right, and prefers to use the right upper extremity more than the left. Mother reports he postures the left upper extremity when running. He is being followed by Medical Therapy Unit and has also been seen in the past by Dr. X. He has not received Botox or any other interventions with regard to his cerebral palsy.The patient did require one shunt revision, but since then his shunt has done well.The patient developed seizures about 2 years ago. These occurred periodically, but they are always in the same and with the involvement of the left side more than right and he had an eye deviation forcefully to the left side. His events, however, always tend to be prolonged. He has had seizures as long as an hour and a half. He tends to require multiple medications to stop them. He has been followed by Dr. Y and was started on Trileptal. At one point, The patient was taken off his medication for presumed failure to prevent his seizures. He was more recently placed on Topamax since March 2007. His last seizures were in March and May respectively. He is worked up to a dose of 25 mg capsules, 2 capsules twice a day or about 5 mg/kg/day at this point.The patient was in his usual state of health until early this morning and was noted to be in seizure. His seizure this morning was similar to the previous seizures with forced deviation of his head and eyes to the left side and convulsion more on the left side than the right. Family administered Diastat 7.5 mg x1 dose. They did not know they could repeat this dose. EMS was called and he received lorazepam 2 mg and then in the emergency department, 15 mg/kg of fosphenytoin. His seizures stopped thereafter, since that time, he had gradually become more alert and is eating, and is nearly back to baseline. He is a bit off balance and tends to be a bit weaker on the left side compared to baseline postictally.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: At this time, he is positive for a low-grade fever, he has had no signs of illness otherwise. He does have some fevers after his prolonged seizures. He denies any respiratory or cardiovascular complaints. There is no numbness or loss of skills. He has no rashes, arthritis or arthralgias. He has no oropharyngeal complaints. Visual or auditory complaints.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Also positive for some mild scoliosis.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives at home with mother, father, and 2 other siblings. There are no ill contacts.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: The patient is a well-nourished, well-hydrated male, in no acute distress.VITAL SIGNS: His vital signs are stable and he is currently afebrile.HEENT: Atraumatic and normocephalic. Oropharynx shows no lesions.NECK: Supple without adenopathy.CHEST: Clear to auscultation.CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.ABDOMEN: Benign without organomegaly.EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.NEUROLOGIC: The patient is alert and will follow instructions. His speech is very dysarthric and he tends to run his words together. He is about 50% understandable at best. He does put words and sentences together. His cranial nerves reveal his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. His extraocular movements are intact. His visual fields are full. Disks are sharp bilaterally. His face shows left facial weakness postictally. His palate elevates midline. Vision is intact bilaterally. Tongue protrudes midline.Motor exam reveals clearly decreased strength on the left side at baseline. His left thigh is abducted at the hip at rest with the right thigh and leg straight. He has difficulty using the left arm and while reaching for objects, shows exaggerated tremor/dysmetria. Right upper extremity is much more on target. His sensations are intact to light touch bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. When sitting up, he shows some truncal instability and tendency towards decreased truncal tone and kyphosis. He also shows some scoliotic curve of the spine, which is mild at this point. Gait was not tested today.IMPRESSION: This is a 6-year-old male with recurrent status epilepticus, left hemiparesis, history of prematurity, and intraventricular hemorrhage. He is on Topamax, which is at a moderate dose of 5 mg/kg a day or 50 mg twice a day. At this point, it is not clear whether this medication will protect him or not, but the dose is clearly not at maximum, and he is tolerating the dose currently. The plan will be to increase him up to 50 mg in the morning, and 75 mg at night for 2 weeks, and then 75 mg twice daily. Reviewed the possible side effects of higher doses of Topamax, they will monitor him for language issues, cognitive problems or excessive somnolence. I also discussed his imaging studies, which showed significant destruction of the cerebellum compared to other areas and despite this, the patient at baseline has a reasonable balance. The plan from CT standpoint is to continue stretching program, continue with medical therapy unit. He may benefit from Botox.In addition, I reviewed the Diastat protocol with parents and given the patient tends to go into status epilepticus each time, they can administer Diastat immediately and not wait the standard 2 minutes or even 5 minutes that they were waiting before. They are going to repeat the dose within 10 minutes and they can call EMS at any point during that time. Hopefully at home, they need to start to abort these seizures or the higher dose of Topamax will prevent them. Other medication options would include Keppra, Zonegran or Lamictal.FOLLOWUP: Followup has already been scheduled with Dr. Y in February and they will continue to keep that date for followup."
437,Neurology,"TITLE OF OPERATION: Right suboccipital craniectomy for resection of tumor using the microscope modifier 22 and cranioplasty.INDICATION FOR SURGERY: The patient with a large 3.5 cm acoustic neuroma. The patient is having surgery for resection. There was significant cerebellar peduncle compression. The tumor was very difficult due to its size as well as its adherence to the brainstem and the nerve complex. The case took 12 hours. This was more difficult and took longer than the usual acoustic neuroma.PREOP DIAGNOSIS: Right acoustic neuroma.POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: Right acoustic neuroma.PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room. General anesthesia was induced in the usual fashion. After appropriate lines were placed, the patient was placed in Mayfield 3-point head fixation, hold into a right park bench position to expose the right suboccipital area. A time-out was settled with nursing and anesthesia, and the head was shaved, prescrubbed with chlorhexidine, prepped and draped in the usual fashion. The incision was made and cautery was used to expose the suboccipital bone. Once the suboccipital bone was exposed under the foramen magnum, the high speed drill was used to thin out the suboccipital bone and the craniectomy carried out with Leksell and insertion with Kerrison punches down to the rim of the foramen magnum as well as laterally to the edge of the sigmoid sinus and superiorly to the edge of the transverse sinus. The dura was then opened in a cruciate fashion, the cisterna magna was drained, which nicely relaxed the cerebellum. The dura leaves were held back with the 4-0 Nurolon. The microscope was then brought into the field, and under the microscope, the cerebellar hemisphere was elevated. Laterally, the arachnoid was very thick. This was opened with bipolar and microscissors and this allowed for the cerebellum to be further mobilized until the tumor was identified. The tumor was quite large and filled up the entire lateral aspect of the right posterior fossa. Initially two retractors were used, one on the tentorium and one inferiorly. The arachnoid was taken down off the tumor. There were multiple blood vessels on the surface, which were bipolared. The tumor surface was then opened with microscissors and the Cavitron was used to began debulking the lesion. This was a very difficult resection due to the extreme stickiness and adherence to the cerebellar peduncle and the lateral cerebellum; however, as the tumor was able to be debulked, the edge began to be mobilized. The redundant capsule was bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor. Working inferiorly and then superiorly, the tumor was taken down off the tentorium as well as out the 9th, 10th or 11th nerve complex. It was very difficult to identify the 7th nerve complex. The brainstem was identified above the complex. Similarly, inferiorly the brainstem was able to be identified and cotton balls were placed to maintain this plain. Attention was then taken to try identify the 7th nerve complex. There were multitude of veins including the lateral pontine vein, which were coming right into this area. The lateral pontine vein was maintained. Microscissors and bipolar were used to develop the plain, and then working inferiorly, the 7th nerve was identified coming off the brainstem. A number 1 and number 2 microinstruments were then used to began to develop the plane. This then allowed for the further appropriate plane medially to be identified and cotton balls were then placed. A number 11 and number 1 microinstrument continued to be used to free up the tumor from the widely spread out 7th nerve. Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion and then further dissection was carried out. The nerve stimulated beautifully at the brainstem level throughout this. The tumor continued to be mobilized off the lateral pontine vein until it was completely off. The Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion out back laterally towards the area of the porus. The tumor was debulked and the capsule continued to be separated with number 11microinstrument as well as the number 1 microinstrument to roll the tumor laterally up towards the porus. At this point, the capsule was so redundant, it was felt to isolate the nerve in the porus. There was minimal bulk remaining intracranially. All the cotton balls were removed and the nerve again stimulated beautifully at the brainstem. Dr. X then came in and scrubbed into the case to drill out the porus and remove the piece of the tumor that was left in the porus and coming out of the porus.I then scrubbed back into case once Dr. X had completed removing this portion of the tumor. There was no tumor remaining at this point. I placed some Norian in the porus to seal any air cells, although there were no palpated. An intradural space was then irrigated thoroughly. There was no bleeding. The nerve was attempted to be stimulated at the brainstem level, but it did not stimulate at this time. The dura was then closed with 4-0 Nurolons in interrupted fashion. A muscle plug was used over one area. Duragen was laid and strips over the suture line followed by Hemaseel. Gelfoam was set over this and then a titanium cranioplasty was carried out. The wound was then irrigated thoroughly. O Vicryls were used to close the deep muscle and fascia, 3-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissue, and 3-0 nylon on the skin.The patient was extubated and taken to the ICU in stable condition."
438,Neurology,"AB CD, M.D.XYZ StreetCity, StateDear Dr. CD:Thank you for seeing Mr. XYZ, a pleasant 19-year-old male who has seen you in 2005 for suspected seizure activity. He comes to my office today continuing on Dilantin 300 mg daily and has been seizure episode free for the past 2 1/2 years. He is requesting to come off the Dilantin at this point. Upon reviewing your 2005 note there was some discrepancy as to the true nature of his episodes to the emergency room and there was consideration to reconsider medication use. His physical exam, neurologically, is normal at this time. His Dilantin level is slightly low at 12.5.I will appreciate your evaluation and recommendation as to whether we need to continue the Dilantin at this time. I understand this will probably entail repeating his EEG and so please coordinate this through Health Center. I await your response and whether we should continue this medication. If you require any laboratory, we use ABC Diagnostic and any further testing that is needed should be coordinated at Health Center prior to scheduling."
439,Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Rule out temporal arteritis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Rule out temporal arteritis.PROCEDURE: Bilateral temporal artery biopsy.ANESTHESIA: Local anesthesia 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.INDICATIONS: I was consulted by Dr. X for this patient with bilateral temporal headaches to rule out temporal arteritis. I explained fully the procedure to the patient.PROCEDURE: Both sides were done exactly the same way. After 1% Xylocaine infiltration, a 2 to 3-cm incision was made over the temporal artery. The temporal artery was identified and was grossly normal on both sides. Proximal and distal were ligated with both of 3-0 silk suture and Hemoccult. The specimen of temporal artery was taken from both sides measuring at least 2 to 3 cm. They were sent as separate specimens, right and left labeled. The wound was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures and Dermabond. She tolerated the procedure well."
440,Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Headaches, question of temporal arteritis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Headaches, question of temporal arteritis.PROCEDURE: Bilateral temporal artery biopsies.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After obtaining an informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room where her right temporal area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Xylocaine 1% was utilized and then an incision was made in front of the right ear and deepened anteriorly. The temporal artery was found and exposed in an extension of about 2 cm. The artery was proximally and distally ligated with 6-0 Prolene and also a side branch and a sample was sent for pathology. Hemostasis achieved with a cautery and the incision was closed with a subcuticular suture of Monocryl.Then, the patient was turned and her left temporal area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A similar procedure was performed with 1% Xylocaine and exposed her temporal artery, which was excised in an extent to about 2 cm. This was also proximally and distally ligated with 6-0 Prolene and also side branch. Hemostasis was achieved with a cautery and the skin was closed with a subcuticular suture of Monocryl.Dressings were applied to both areas.The patient tolerated the procedure well. Estimated blood loss was negligible, and the patient went back to Same Day Surgery for recovery."
441,Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: The patient referred by Dr. X for evaluation of her possible tethered cord.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly, she is a 14-year-old right handed female who is in 9th grade, who underwent a lipomyomeningocele repair at 3 days of age and then again at 3-1/2 years of age. The last surgery was in 03/95. She did well; however, in the past several months has had some leg pain in both legs out laterally, worsening at night and requiring Advil, Motrin as well as Tylenol PM.Denies any new bowel or bladder dysfunction or increased sensory loss. She had some patchy sensory loss from L4 to S1.MEDICATIONS: Singulair for occasional asthma.FINDINGS: She is awake, alert, and oriented x 3. Pupils equal and reactive. EOMs are full. Motor is 5 out of 5. She was able to toe and heel walk without any difficulties as well as tendon reflexes were 2 plus. There is no evidence of clonus. There is diminished sensation from L4 to S1, having proprioception.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Possible tethered cord. I had a thorough discussion with the patient and her parents. I have recommended a repeat MRI scan. The prescription was given today. MRI of the lumbar spine was just completed. I would like to see her back in clinic. We did discuss the possible symptoms of this tethering."
442,Neurology,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: This 92-year-old female states that last night she had a transient episode of slurred speech and numbness of her left cheek for a few hours. However, the chart indicates that she had recurrent TIAs x3 yesterday, each lasting about 5 minutes with facial drooping and some mental confusion. She had also complained of blurred vision for several days. She was brought to the emergency room last night, where she was noted to have a left carotid bruit and was felt to have recurrent TIAs.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: The patient is on Lanoxin, amoxicillin, Hydergine, Cardizem, Lasix, Micro-K and a salt-free diet. SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke or drink alcohol.FINDINGS: Admission CT scan of the head showed a densely calcified mass lesion of the sphenoid bone, probably representing the benign osteochondroma seen on previous studies. CBC was normal, aside from a hemoglobin of 11.2. ECG showed atrial fibrillation. BUN was 22, creatinine normal, CPK normal, glucose normal, electrolytes normal.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, the patient is noted to be alert and fully oriented. She has some impairment of recent memory. She is not dysphasic, or apraxic. Speech is normal and clear. The head is noted to be normocephalic. Neck is supple. Carotid pulses are full bilaterally, with left carotid bruit. Neurologic exam shows cranial nerve function II through XII to be intact, save for some slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold. Motor examination shows no drift of the outstretched arms. There is no tremor or past-pointing. Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin performed well bilaterally. Motor showed intact neuromuscular tone, strength, and coordination in all limbs. Reflexes 1+ and symmetrical, with bilateral plantar flexion, absent jaw jerk, no snout. Sensory exam is intact to pinprick touch, vibration, position, temperature, and graphesthesia.IMPRESSION: Neurological examination is normal, aside from mild impairment of recent memory, slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold, and left carotid bruit. She also has atrial fibrillation, apparently chronic. In view of her age and the fact that she is in chronic atrial fibrillation, I would suspect that she most likely has had an embolic phenomenon as the cause of her TIAs.RECOMMENDATIONS: I would recommend conservative management with antiplatelet agents unless a near occlusion of the carotid arteries is demonstrated, in which case you might consider it best to do an angiography and consider endarterectomy. In view of her age, I would be reluctant to recommend Coumadin anticoagulation. I will be happy to follow the patient with you."
443,Neurology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Transient visual loss lasting five minutes.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a very active and pleasant 82-year-old white male with a past medical history significant for first-degree AV block, status post pacemaker placement, hypothyroidism secondary to hyperthyroidism and irradiation, possible lumbar stenosis. He reports he experienced a single episode of his vision decreasing ""like it was compressed from the top down with a black sheet coming down"". The episode lasted approximately five minutes and occurred three weeks ago while he was driving a car. He was able to pull the car over to the side of the road safely. During the episode, he felt nauseated and possibly lightheaded. His wife was present and noted that he looked extremely pale and ashen during the episode. He went to see the Clinic at that time and received a CT scan, carotid Dopplers, echocardiogram, and neurological evaluation, all of which were unremarkable. It was suggested at that time that he get a CT angiogram since he cannot have an MRI due to his pacemaker. He has had no further similar events. He denies any lesions or other visual change, focal weakness or sensory change, headaches, gait change or other neurological problem.He also reports that he has been diagnosed with lumbar stenosis based on some mild difficulty arising from a chair for which an outside physician ordered a CT of his L-spine that reportedly showed lumbar stenosis. The question has arisen as to whether he should have a CT myelogram to further evaluate this process. He has no back pain or pain of any type, he denies bowel or bladder incontinence or frank lower extremity weakness. He is extremely active and plays tennis at least three times a week. He denies recent episodes of unexpected falls.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He only endorses hypothyroidism, the episode of visual loss described above and joint pain. He also endorses having trouble getting out of a chair, but otherwise his review of systems is negative. A copy is in his clinic chart.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above. He has had bilateral knee replacement three years ago and experiences some pain in his knees with this.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.SOCIAL HISTORY: He is retired from the social security administration x 20 years. He travels a lot and is extremely active. He does not smoke. He consumes alcohol socially only. He does not use illicit drugs. He is married.MEDICATIONS: The patient has recently been started on Plavix by his primary care doctor, was briefly on baby aspirin 81 mg per day since the TIA-like event three weeks ago. He also takes Proscar 5 mg q.d and Synthroid 0.2 mg q.d.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Vital Signs: BP 134/80, heart rate 60, respiratory rate 16, and weight 244 pounds. He denies any pain.General: This is a pleasant white male in no acute distress.HEENT: He is normocephalic and atraumatic. Conjunctivae and sclerae are clear. There is no sinus tenderness.Neck: Supple.Chest: Clear to auscultation.Heart: There are no bruits present.Extremities: Extremities are warm and dry. Distal pulses are full. There is no edema.NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:MENTAL STATUS: He is alert and oriented to person, place and time with good recent and long-term memory. His language is fluent. His attention and concentration are good.CRANIAL NERVES: Cranial nerves II through XII are intact. VFFTC, PERRL, EOMI, facial sensation and expression are symmetric, hearing is decreased on the right (hearing aid), palate rises symmetrically, shoulder shrug is strong, tongue protrudes in the midline.MOTOR: He has normal bulk and tone throughout. There is no cogwheeling. There is some minimal weakness at the iliopsoas bilaterally 4+/5 and possibly trace weakness at the quadriceps -5/5. Otherwise he is 5/5 throughout including hip adductors and abductors.SENSORY: He has decreased sensation to vibration and proprioception to the middle of his feet only, otherwise sensory is intact to light touch, and temperature, pinprick, proprioception and vibration.COORDINATION: There is no dysmetria or tremor noted. His Romberg is negative. Note that he cannot rise from the chair without using his arms.GAIT: Upon arising, he has a normal step, stride, and toe, heel. He has difficulty with tandem and tends to fall to the left.REFLEXES: 2 at biceps, triceps, patella and 1 at ankles.The patient provided a CT scan without contrast from his previous hospitalization three weeks ago, which is normal to my inspection.He has had full labs for cholesterol and stroke for risk factors although he does not have those available here.IMPRESSION:1. TIA. The character of his brief episode of visual loss is concerning for compromise of the posterior circulation. Differential diagnoses include hypoperfusion, stenosis, and dissection. He is to get a CT angiogram to evaluate the integrity of the cerebrovascular system. He has recently been started on Paxil by his primary care physician and this should be continued. Other risk factors need to be evaluated; however, we will wait for the results to be sent from the outside hospital so that we do not have to repeat his prior workup. The patient and his wife assure me that the workup was complete and that nothing was found at that time.2. Lumbar stenosis. His symptoms are very mild and consist mainly of some mild proximal upper extremity weakness and very mild gait instability. In the absence of motor stabilizing symptoms, the patient is not interested in surgical intervention at this time. Therefore we would defer further evaluation with CT myelogram as he does not want surgery.PLAN:1. We will get a CT angiogram of the cerebral vessels.2. Continue Plavix.3. Obtain copies of the workup done at the outside hospital.4. We will follow the lumbar stenosis for the time being. No further workup is planned."
444,Neurology,"PROCEDURE: Subcutaneous ulnar nerve transposition.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.A curvilinear incision was made over the medial elbow, starting proximally at the medial intermuscular septum, curving posterior to the medial epicondyle, then curving anteriorly along the path of the ulnar nerve. Dissection was carried down to the ulnar nerve. Branches of the medial antebrachial and the medial brachial cutaneous nerves were identified and protected.Osborne's fascia was released, an ulnar neurolysis performed, and the ulnar nerve was mobilized. Six cm of the medial intermuscular septum was excised, and the deep periosteal origin of the flexor carpi ulnaris was released to avoid kinking of the nerve as it was moved anteriorly.The subcutaneous plane just superficial to the flexor-pronator mass was developed. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery. The nerve was transposed anteriorly, superficial to the flexor-pronator mass. Motor branches were dissected proximally and distally to avoid tethering or kinking the ulnar nerve.A semicircular medially based flap of flexor-pronator fascia was raised and sutured to the subcutaneous tissue in such a way as to prevent the nerve from relocating. The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed with simple interrupted sutures. Marcaine with epinephrine was injected into the wound. The elbow was dressed and splinted. The patient was awakened and sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."

Greater saphenous vein stripping and stab phlebectomies requiring 10 to 20 incisions, right leg.2. Greater saphenous vein stripping and stab phlebectomies requiring 10 to 20 incisions, left leg.PROCEDURE DETAIL: After obtaining the informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room where she underwent a general endotracheal anesthesia. A time-out process was followed and antibiotics were given.Then, both legs were prepped and draped in the usual fashion with the patient was in the supine position. An incision was made in the right groin and the greater saphenous vein at its junction with the femoral vein was dissected out and all branches were ligated and divided. Then, an incision was made just below the knee where the greater saphenous vein was also found and connection to varices from the calf were seen. A third incision was made in the distal third of the right thigh in the area where there was a communication with large branch varicosities. Then, a vein stripper was passed from the right calf up to the groin and the greater saphenous vein, which was divided, was stripped without any difficultly. Several minutes of compression was used for hemostasis. Then, the exposed branch varicosities both in the lower third of the thigh and in the calf were dissected out and then many stabs were performed to do stab phlebectomies at the level of the thigh and the level of the calf as much as the position would allow us to do.Then in the left thigh, a groin incision was made and the greater saphenous vein was dissected out in the same way as was on the other side. Also, an incision was made in the level of the knee and the saphenous vein was isolated there. The saphenous vein was stripped and a several minutes of local compression was performed for hemostasis. Then, a number of stabs to perform phlebectomy were performed at the level of the calf to excise branch varicosities to the extent that the patient's position would allow us. Then, all incisions were closed in layers with Vicryl and staples.Then, the patient was placed in the prone position and the stab phlebectomies of the right thigh and calf and left thigh and calf were performed using 10 to 20 stabs in each leg. The stab phlebectomies were performed with a hook and they were very satisfactory. Hemostasis achieved with compression and then staples were applied to the skin.Then, the patient was rolled onto a stretcher where both legs were wrapped with the Kerlix, fluffs, and Ace bandages.Estimated blood loss probably was about 150 mL. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room in satisfactory condition. The patient is to be observed, so a decision will be made whether she needs to stay overnight or be able to go home."

His condition is felt to be critical. In a desperate attempt to relieve increased intracranial pressure, we have proposed placing a ventriculostomy. I have discussed this with patient's wife who agrees and asked that we proceed emergently.After a sterile prep, drape, and shaving of the hair over the left frontal area, this area is infiltrated with local anesthetic. Subsequently a 1 cm incision was made over Kocher's point. Hemostasis was obtained. Then a twist drill was made over this area. Bones strips were irrigated away. The dura was perforated with a spinal needle.A Camino monitor was connected and zeroed. This was then passed into the left lateral ventricle on the first pass. Excellent aggressive very bloody CSF under pressure was noted. This stopped, slowed, and some clots were noted. This was irrigated and then CSF continued. Initial opening pressures were 30, but soon arose to 80 or a 100.The patient tolerated the procedure well. The wound was stitched shut and the ventricular drain was then connected to a drainage bag.Platelets and FFP as well as vitamin K have been administered and ordered simultaneously with the placement of this device to help prevent further clotting or bleeding."

451,Neurology,"Doctor's NameDoctor's AddressDear Doctor:This letter is an introduction to my patient, A, who you will be seeing in the near future. He is a pleasant gentleman with a history of Wilson's disease. It has been treated with penicillamine. He was diagnosed with this at age 14. He was on his way to South Carolina for a trip when he developed shortness of breath, palpitations, and chest discomfort. He went to the closest hospital that they were near in Randolph, North Carolina and he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid rate. He was admitted there and observed. He converted to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and so he required no further interventions. He was started on Lopressor, which he has tolerated well. An echocardiogram was performed, which revealed mild-to-moderate left atrial enlargement. Normal ejection fraction. No other significant valvular abnormality. He reported to physicians there that he had cirrhosis related to his Wilson's disease. Therefore hepatologist was consulted. There was a recommendation to avoid Coumadin secondary to his questionable significant liver disease, therefore he was placed on aspirin 325 mg once a day.In discussion with Mr. A and review of his chart that I have available, it is unclear as to the status of his liver disease, however, he has never had a liver biopsy, so his diagnosis of cirrhosis that they were concerned about in North Carolina is in doubt. His LFTs have remained normal and his copper level has been undetectable on his current dose of penicillamine.I would appreciate your input into the long term management of his anticoagulation and also any recommendations you would have about rhythm control. He is in normal sinus rhythm as of my evaluation of him on 06/12/2008. He is tolerating his metoprolol and aspirin without any difficulty. I guess the big question remains is what level of risk that is entailed by placing him on Coumadin therapy due to his potentially paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and evidence of left atrial enlargement that would place him in increased risk of recurrent episodes.I appreciate your input regarding this friendly gentleman. His current medicines include penicillamine 250 mg p.o. four times a day, metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day, and aspirin 325 mg a day.If you have any questions regarding his care, please feel free to call me to discuss his case. Otherwise, I will look forward to hearing back from you regarding his evaluation. Thank you as always for your care of our patient."
