0,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES1. Adrenal mass, right sided.2. Umbilical hernia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES1. Adrenal mass, right sided.2. Umbilical hernia.OPERATION PERFORMED: Laparoscopic hand-assisted left adrenalectomy and umbilical hernia repair.ANESTHESIA: General.CLINICAL NOTE: This is a 52-year-old inmate with a 5.5 cm diameter nonfunctioning mass in his right adrenal. Procedure was explained including risks of infection, bleeding, possibility of transfusion, possibility of further treatments being required. Alternative of fully laparoscopic are open surgery or watching the lesion.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: In the right flank-up position, table was flexed. He had a Foley catheter in place. Incision was made from just above the umbilicus, about 5.5 cm in diameter. The umbilical hernia was taken down. An 11 mm trocar was placed in the midline, superior to the GelPort and a 5 mm trocar placed in the midaxillary line below the costal margin. A liver retractor was placed to this.The colon was reflected medially by incising the white line of Toldt. The liver attachments to the adrenal kidney were divided and the liver was reflected superiorly. The vena cava was identified. The main renal vein was identified. Coming superior to the main renal vein, staying right on the vena cava, all small vessels were clipped and then divided. Coming along the superior pole of the kidney, the tumor was dissected free from top of the kidney with clips and Bovie. The harmonic scalpel was utilized superiorly and laterally. Posterior attachments were divided between clips and once the whole adrenal was mobilized, the adrenal vein and one large adrenal artery were noted, doubly clipped, and divided. Specimen was placed in a collection bag, removed intact.Hemostasis was excellent.The umbilical hernia had been completely taken down. The edges were freshened up. Vicryl #1 was utilized to close the incision and 2-0 Vicryl was used to close the fascia of the trocar.Skin closed with clips.He tolerated the procedure well. All sponge and instrument counts were correct. Estimated blood loss less than 100 mL.The patient was awakened, extubated, and returned to recovery room in satisfactory condition."
1,Urology,"The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating room table. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered. The patient was shaved, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion.Initially a small incision was made in the right superior hemiscrotum and the incision was carried down to the vas deferens. This incision was carried down to the area of the previous vasectomy. A towel clip was placed around this. Next the scarred area was dissected free back to normal vas proximally and distally. Approximately 4 cm of vas was freed up. Next the vas was amputated above and below the scar tissue. Fine hemostats were used to grasp the adventitial tissue on each side of the vas, both the proximal and distal ends. Both ends were then dilated very carefully with lacrimal duct probes up to a #2 successfully. After accomplishing this, fluid could be milked from the proximal vas which was encouraging.Next the reanastomosis was performed. Three 7-0 Prolene were used and full thickness bites were taken through the muscle layer of the vas deferens and into the lumen. This was all done with 3.5 loupe magnification. Next the vas ends were pulled together by tying the sutures. A good reapproximation was noted. Next in between each of these sutures two to three of the 7-0 Prolenes were used to reapproximate the muscularis layer further in an attempt to make this fluid-tight.There was no tension on the anastomosis and the vas was delivered back into the right hemiscrotum. The subcuticular layers were closed with a running 3-0 chromic and the skin was closed with three interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.Next an identical procedure was done on the left side.The patient tolerated the procedure well and was awakened and returned to the recovery room in stable condition. Antibiotic ointment, fluffs, and a scrotal support were placed."
2,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Stress urinary incontinence, intrinsic sphincter deficiency.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Stress urinary incontinence, intrinsic sphincter deficiency.OPERATIONS: Cystoscopy, cystocele repair, BioArc midurethral sling.ANESTHESIA: Spinal.EBL: Minimal.FLUIDS: Crystalloid.BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of hysterectomy, complained of urgency, frequency, and stress urinary incontinence. The patient had urodynamics done and a cystoscopy, which revealed intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Options such as watchful waiting, Kegel exercises, broad-based sling to help with ISD versus Coaptite bulking agents were discussed. Risks and benefits of all the procedures were discussed. The patient understood and wanted to proceed with BioArc. Risk of failure of the procedure, recurrence of incontinence due to urgency, mesh erosion, exposure, etc., were discussed. Risk of MI, DVT, PE, and bleeding etc., were discussed. The patient understood the risk of infection and wanted to proceed with the procedure. The patient was told that due to the intrinsic sphincter deficiency, we will try to make the sling little bit tighter to allow better urethral closure, which may put her a high risk of retention versus if we make it too loose, then she may leak afterwards.The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure.DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A Foley catheter was placed. Bladder was emptied. Two Allis clamps were placed on the anterior vaginal mucosa. Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine was applied, and hydrodissection was done. Incision was made. A bladder was lifted off of the vaginal mucosa. The bladder cystocele was reduced. Two stab incisions were placed on the lateral thigh over the medial aspect of the obturator canal. Using BioArc needle, the needles were passed through under direct palpation through the vaginal incision from the lateral thigh to the vaginal incision. The mesh arms were attached and arms were pulled back the outer plastic sheath and the excess mesh was removed. The mesh was right at the bladder neck to the mid-urethra, completely covering over the entire urethra.The sling was kept little tight, even though the right angle was easily placed between the urethra and the BioArc material. The urethra was coapted very nicely. At the end of the procedure, cystoscopy was done and there was no injury to the bladder. There was good efflux of urine with indigo carmine coming through from both the ureteral openings. The urethra was normal, seemed to have closed up very nicely with the repair. The vaginal mucosa was closed using 0 Vicryl in interrupted fashion. The lateral thigh incisions were closed using Dermabond. Please note that the irrigation with antibiotic solution was done prior to the BioArc mesh placement. The mesh was placed in antibiotic solution prior to the placement in the body. The patient tolerated the procedure well. After closure, Premarin cream was applied. The patient was told to use Premarin cream postop. The patient was brought to Recovery in stable condition.The patient was told not to do any heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, and no tub bath, etc., for at least 2 months. The patient understood. The patient was to follow up as an outpatient."
3,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bladder lesions with history of previous transitional cell bladder carcinoma.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bladder lesions with history of previous transitional cell bladder carcinoma, pathology pending.OPERATION PERFORMED: Cystoscopy, bladder biopsies, and fulguration.ANESTHESIA: General.INDICATION FOR OPERATION: This is a 73-year-old gentleman who was recently noted to have some erythematous, somewhat raised bladder lesions in the bladder mucosa at cystoscopy. He was treated for a large transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with TURBT in 2002 and subsequently underwent chemotherapy because of pulmonary nodules. He has had some low grade noninvasive small tumor recurrences on one or two occasions over the past 18 months. Recent cystoscopy raises suspicion of another recurrence.OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The entire bladder was actually somewhat erythematous with mucosa looking somewhat hyperplastic particularly in the right dome and lateral wall of the bladder. Scarring was noted along the base of the bladder from the patient's previous cysto TURBT. Ureteral orifice on the right side was not able to be identified. The left side was unremarkable.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room. He was placed on the operating table. General anesthesia was administered after which the patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. The genitalia and lower abdomen were prepared with Betadine and draped subsequently. The urethra and bladder were inspected under video urology equipment (25 French panendoscope) with the findings as noted above. Cup biopsies were taken in two areas from the right lateral wall of the bladder, the posterior wall of bladder, and the bladder neck area. Each of these biopsy sites were fulgurated with Bugbee electrodes. Inspection of the sites after completing the procedure revealed no bleeding and bladder irrigant was clear. The patient's bladder was then emptied. Cystoscope removed and the patient was awakened and transferred to the postanesthetic recovery area. There were no apparent complications, and the patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well. Estimated blood loss was less than 15 mL."
4,Urology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Bladder cancer.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a history of gross hematuria. The patient presented to the emergency room near his hometown on 12/24/2007 for evaluation of this gross hematuria. CT scan was performed, which demonstrated no hydronephrosis or upper tract process; however, there was significant thickening of the left and posterior bladder wall. Urology referral was initiated and the patient was sent to be evaluated by Dr. X. He eventually underwent a bladder biopsy on 01/18/08, which demonstrated high-grade transitional cell carcinoma without any muscularis propria in the specimen. Additionally, the patient underwent workup for a right adrenal lesion, which was noted on the initial CT scan. This workup involved serum cortisol analysis as well as potassium and aldosterone and ACTH level measurement. All of this workup was found to be grossly negative. Secondary to the absence of muscle in the specimen, the patient was taken back to the operating room on 02/27/08 by Dr. X and the tumor was noted to be very large with significant tumor burden as well as possible involvement of the bladder neck. At that time, the referring urologist determined the tumor to be too large and risky for local resection, and the patient was referred to ABCD Urology for management and diagnosis. The patient presents today for evaluation by Dr. Y.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes condyloma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, undiagnosed COPD, peripheral vascular disease, and claudication. The patient denies coronary artery disease.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Includes bladder biopsy on 01/18/08 without muscularis propria in the high-grade TCC specimen and a gun shot wound in 1984 followed by exploratory laparotomy x2. The patient denies any bowel resection or GU injury at that time; however, he is unsure.CURRENT MEDICATIONS:1. Metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d.2. Diltiazem 120 mg daily.3. Hydrocodone 10/500 mg p.r.n.4.

The liver and spleen are not palpably enlarged. There is a large midline defect covered by skin, of which the fascia has numerous holes poking through. These small hernias are of approximately 2 cm in diameter at the largest and are nontender. GU: The penis is circumcised and there are no lesions, plaques, masses or deformities. There is some tenderness to palpation near the meatus where 20-French Foley catheter is in place. Testes are bilaterally descended and there are no masses or tenderness. There is bilateral mild atrophy. Epididymidis are grossly within normal limits bilaterally. Spermatic cords are grossly within normal limits. There are no palpable inguinal hernias. RECTAL: The prostate is mildly enlarged with a small focal firm area in the midline near the apex. There is however no other focal nodules. The prostate is grossly approximately 35 to 40 g and is globally firm. Rectal sphincter tone is grossly within normal limits and there is stool in the rectal vault. EXTREMITIES: Demonstrate no cyanosis, clubbing or edema. There is dark red urine in the Foley bag collection.LABORATORY EXAM: Review of laboratory from outside facility demonstrates creatinine of 2.38 with BUN of 42. Additionally, laboratory exam demonstrates a grossly normal serum cortisol, ACTH, potassium, aldosterone level during lesion workup. CT scan was reviewed from outside facility, report states there is left kidney atrophy without hydro or stones and there is thickened left bladder wall and posterior margins with a balloon inflated in the prostate at the time of the exam. There is a 3.1 cm right heterogeneous adrenal nodule and there are no upper tract lesions or stones noted.IMPRESSION: Bladder cancer.PLAN: The patient will undergo a completion TURBT on 03/20/08 with bilateral retrograde pyelograms at the time of surgery. Preoperative workup and laboratory as well as paper work were performed in clinic today with Dr. Y. The patient will be scheduled for anesthesia preop. The patient will have urine culture redrawn from his Foley or penis at the time of preoperative evaluation with anesthesia. The patient was counseled extensively approximately 45 minutes on the nature of his disease and basic prognostic indicators and need for additional workup and staging. The patient understands these instructions and also agrees to quit smoking prior to his next visit. This patient was seen in evaluation with Dr. Y who agrees with the impression and plan."
5,Urology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient comes for bladder instillation for chronic interstitial cystitis.SUBJECTIVE: The patient is crying today when she arrives in the office saying that she has a lot of discomfort. These bladder instillations do not seem to be helping her. She feels anxious and worried. She does not think she can take any more pain. She is debating whether or not to go back to Dr. XYZ and ask for the nerve block or some treatment modality to stop the pain because she just cannot function on a daily basis and care for her children unless she gets something done about this, and she fears these bladder instillations because they do not seem to help. They seem to be intensifying her pain. She has the extra burden of each time she comes needing to have pain medication one way or another, thus then we would not allow her to drive under the influence of the pain medicine. So, she has to have somebody come with her and that is kind of troublesome to her. We discussed this at length. I did suggest that it was completely appropriate for her to decide. She will terminate these if they are that uncomfortable and do not seem to be giving her any relief, although I did tell her that occasionally people do have discomfort with them and then after the completion of the instillations, they do better and we have also had some people who have had to terminate the instillations because they were too uncomfortable and they could not stand it and they went on to have some other treatment modality. She had Hysterectomy in the past.MEDICATIONS: Premarin 1.25 mg daily, Elmiron 100 mg t.i.d., Elavil 50 mg at bedtime, OxyContin 10 mg three tablets three times a day, Toprol XL 25 mg daily.ALLERGIES: Compazine and Allegra.OBJECTIVE:Vital Signs: Weight: 140 pounds. Blood pressure: 132/90. Pulse: 102. Respirations: 18. Age: 27.PLAN: We discussed going for another evaluation by Dr. XYZ and seeking his opinion. She said that she called him on the phone the other day and told him how miserable she was and he told her that he really thought she needed to complete. The instillations give that a full trial and then he would be willing to see her back. As we discussed these options and she was encouraged to think it over and decide what she would like to do for I could not makeup her mind for her. She said she thought that it was unreasonable to quit now when she only had two or three more treatments to go, but she did indicate that the holiday weekend coming made her fearful and if she was uncomfortable after today�s instillation which she did choose to take then she would choose to cancel Fridays appointment, also that she would not feel too badly over the holiday weekend. I thought that was reasonable and agreed that that would work out.PROCEDURE:: She was then given 10 mg of morphine subcutaneously because she did not feel she could tolerate the discomfort in the instillation without pain medicine. We waited about 20 minutes. The bladder was then instilled and the urethra was instilled with lidocaine gel which she tolerated and then after a 10-minute wait, the bladder was instilled with DMSO, Kenalog, heparin, and sodium bicarbonate, and the catheter was removed. The patient retained the solution for one hour, changing position every 15 minutes and then voided to empty the bladder. She seemed to tolerate it moderately well. She is to call and let me know what she wishes to do about the Friday scheduled bladder instillation if she tolerated this then she is going to consider trying it. If not, she will cancel and will start over next week or she will see Dr. Friesen."
6,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bladder laceration.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bladder laceration.NAME OF OPERATION: Closure of bladder laceration.FINDINGS: The patient was undergoing a cesarean section for twins. During the course of the procedure, a bladder laceration was notices and urology was consulted. Findings were a laceration on the dome of the bladder.PROCEDURE: Initially there as a mucosal layer of suture already placed. This was done with 3-0 chromic catgut. The bladder was distended and, while the bladder was distended with physiologic saline, a second layer of 3-0 chromic catgut created a watertight closure. The second layer included the mucosa an dinner layer of the detrusor muscle. A third layer of 2-0 Dexon was used. Each of these were placed in a continuous running-locked suture technique. There was complete watertight closure of the bladder. Hemostasis was assured and a Jackson-Pratt drain was brought out through a separate stab wound. The remaining portion of the operation, both the cesarean section and the wound closure, will be dictated by Dr. Redmond."
7,Urology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Recurrent bladder tumor.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 79-year-old woman, the patient of Dr. X, who on recent followup cystoscopy for transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder neck was found to have a 5-cm area of papillomatosis just above the left ureteric orifice. The patient underwent TUR of several transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder on the bladder neck in 2006. This was followed by bladder instillation of BCG. At this time, the patient denies any voiding symptoms or hematuria.

Alkaline phosphatase was 770 and albumin was 2.4. Rest of the values all are within normal limits of the LFTs. Urinalysis was grossly bloody with a large amount of blood and greater than 50 rbc's. The patient also had greater than 300 of the protein reading, moderate leukocytes, 30-50 white blood cells, but no bacteria were seen. Coagulation profile study had a PT of 15.9, PTT of 43 and INR of 1.3.EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient was given normal saline 2 liters over 1 hour without any adverse effect. The patient was given multiple doses of morphine to maintain his comfort while here in the emergency room without any adverse effect. The patient was given Levaquin 500 mg by mouth as well as 2 doses of Phenergan over the course of his stay here in the emergency department. The patient did not have an adverse reaction to these medicines either. Phenergan resolved his nausea and morphine did relieve his pain and make him pain free. I spoke with Dr. X, the patient's urologist, about most appropriate step for the patient, and Dr. X said he would be happy to care for the patient in the hospital and do urologic scopes if necessary and surgery if necessary and blood transfusion. It was all a matter of what the patient wished to do given the advanced stage of his cancer. Dr. X was willing to assist in any way the patient wished him to. I spoke with the patient and his son about what he would like to do and what the options were from doing nothing from keeping him comfortable with pain medicines to admitting him to the hospital with the possibility of scopes and even surgery being done as well as the blood transfusion. The patient decided to choose a middle ground in which he would be transfused with 2 units of blood here in the emergency room and go home tonight. The patient's son felt comfortable with his father's choice. This was done. The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells after appropriately typed and match. The patient did not have any adverse reaction at any point with his transfusion. There was no fever, no shortness of breath, and at the time of disposition, the patient stated he felt a little better and felt like he had a little more strength. Over the course of the patient's several-hour stay in the emergency room, the patient did end up developing enough problems with clotted blood in his bladder that he had a urinary obstruction. Foley catheter was placed, which produced bloody urine and relieved the developing discomfort of a full bladder. The patient was given a leg bag and the Foley catheter was left in place.DIAGNOSES1. HEMATURIA.2. PROSTATE CANCER WITH BONE AND BLADDER METASTATIC DISEASE.3. SIGNIFICANT ANEMIA.4. URINARY OBSTRUCTION.CONDITION ON DISPOSITION: Fair, but improved.DISPOSITION: To home with his son.PLAN: We will have the patient follow up with Dr. X in his office in 2 days for reevaluation. The patient was given a prescription for Levaquin and Phenergan tablets to take home with him tonight. The patient was encouraged to drink extra water. The patient was given discharge instructions on hematuria and asked to return to the emergency room should he have any worsening of his condition or develop any other problems or symptoms of concern."
9,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer.OPERATIONS: Brachytherapy, iodine-125 seed implantation, and cystoscopy.ANESTHESIA: LMA.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.Total number of seeds placed, 63. Needles, 24.BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PATIENT: This is a 57-year-old male who was seen by us for elevated PSA. The patient had a prostate biopsy with T2b disease, Gleason 6. Options such as watchful waiting, robotic prostatectomy, seed implantation with and without radiation were discussed. Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, incontinence, rectal dysfunction, voiding issues, burning pain, unexpected complications such as fistula, rectal injury, urgency, frequency, bladder issues, need for chronic Foley for six months, etc., were discussed. The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options, and wanted to proceed with the procedure. The patient was told that there could be other unexpected complications. The patient has history of urethral stricture. The patient was told about the risk of worsening of the stricture with radiation. Consent was obtained.DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. The patient had SCDs on. The patient was given preop antibiotics. The patient had done bowel prep the day before. Transrectal ultrasound was performed. The prostate was measured at about 32 gm. The images were transmitted to the computer system for radiation oncologist to determine the dosing etc. Based on the computer analysis, the grid was placed. Careful attention was drawn to keep the grid away from the patient. There was a centimeter distance between the skin and the grid. Under ultrasound guidance, the needles were placed, first in the periphery of the prostate, a total of 63 seeds were placed throughout the prostate. A total of 24 needles was used. Careful attention was drawn to stay away from the urethra. Under longitudinal ultrasound guidance, all the seeds were placed. There were no seeds visualized in the bladder under ultrasound. There was only one needle where the seeds kind of dragged as the needle was coming out on the left side and were dropped out of position. Other than that, all the seeds were very well distributed throughout the prostate under fluoroscopy. Please note that the Foley catheter was in place throughout the procedure. Prior to the seed placement, the Foley was attempted to be placed, but we had to do it using a Glidewire to get the Foley in and we used a Councill-tip catheter. The patient has had history of bulbar urethral stricture. Pictures were taken of the strictures in the pre-seed placement cysto time frame. We needed to do the cystoscopy and Glidewire to be able to get the Foley catheter in. At the end of the procedure, again cystoscopy was done, the entire bladder was visualized. The stricture was wide open. The prostate was slightly enlarged. The bladder appeared normal. There was no sheath inside the urethra or in the bladder. The cysto was done using 30-degree and 70-degree lens. At the end of the procedure, a Glidewire was placed, and 18 Councill-tip catheter was placed. The plan was for Foley to be left in place overnight since the patient has history of urethral strictures. The patient is to follow up tomorrow to have the Foley removed. The patient could also be shown to have it removed at home.The patient was brought to Recovery in stable condition at the end of the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
10,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Refractory priapism.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Refractory priapism.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Cavernosaphenous shunt.ANESTHESIA: General.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 400 cc.FLUIDS: IV fluids 1600 crystalloids, one liter packed red blood cells.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 34-year-old African-American male who is known to our service with a history of recurrent priapism. The patient presented with priapism x48 hours on this visit. The patient underwent corporal aspiration and Winter's shunt both of which failed and then subsequently underwent _______ procedure. The patient's priapism did return following this and he was scheduled for cavernosaphenous shunt.PROCEDURE: Informed written consent was obtained. The patient was taken to the operative suite and administered anesthetic. The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the supine fashion. A #15 French Foley catheter was inserted under sterile conditions. Incision was made in the left base of the penile shaft on the lateral aspect, approximately 3 cm in length. Tissue was dissected down to the level of the corpora cavernosum and corpora spongiosum. The fascia was incised in elliptical fashion for approximately 2 cm. A #14 gauge Angiocath was inserted into the corpora cavernosum to the glans of the penis and the corpora was irrigated copiously until all of the old clotted blood was removed and fresher irrigation was noted.Attention was then turned to the left groin and the superficial saphenous vein was harvested. Due to incisions brought up into the initial incision after gauging enough length, this was then spatulated with Potts scissors for approximately 2 cm. Vein was irrigated. One branching vessel was noted to be leaking, this was tied off and repeat injection with heparinized saline showed no additional leaks. Tunnel was then created from the superior most groin region to the incision in the penile shaft. Saphenous vein was then passed through this tunnel with the aid of a hemostat. Anastomosis was performed using #5-0 Prolene suture in a running fashion from proximal to distal. There were no leaks noted. There was good flow noted within the saphenous vein graft. Penis was noted to be in a flaccid state. All incisions were irrigated copiously and closed in several layers. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient was cleaned, transferred to recovery room in stable condition.PLAN: We will continue with antibiotics for pain control, maintain Foley catheter. Further recommendations to follow."
11,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Phimosis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Phimosis.OPERATIONS: Circumcision.ANESTHESIA: LMA.EBL: Minimal.FLUIDS: Crystalloid.BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 3-year-old male, who was referred to us from Dr. X's office with phimosis. The patient had spraying of urine and ballooning of the foreskin with voiding. The urine seemed to have collected underneath the foreskin and then would slowly drip out. Options such as dorsal slit, circumcision, watchful waiting by gently pulling the foreskin back were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, scarring, and expected complications were discussed. The patient's family understood all the complications and wanted to proceed with the procedure. Consent was obtained using interpreter.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in supine position. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. All the penile adhesions were released prior to the prepping. The extra foreskin was marked off, 1 x 3 Gamco clamp was used. Hemostasis was obtained after removing the extra foreskin using the Gamco clamp.Using 5-0 Monocryl, 4 quadrant stitches were placed and horizontal mattress suturing was done. There was excellent hemostasis. Dermabond was applied. The patient was brought to recovery at the end of the procedure in stable condition."
12,Urology,"CIRCUMCISION - OLDER PERSONOPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 4-0 silk suture is used as a stay-stitch of the glans penis. Next, incision line was marked circumferentially on the outer skin 3 mm below the corona. The incision was then carried through the skin and subcutaneous tissues down to within a layer of * fascia. Next, the foreskin was retracted. Another circumferential incision was made 3 mm proximal to the corona. The intervening foreskin was excised. Meticulous hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery. Next, the skin was reapproximated at the frenulum with a U stitch of 5-0 chromic followed by stitches at 12, 3, and 9 o'clock. The stitches were placed equal distance among these to reapproximate all the skin edges. Next, good cosmetic result was noted with no bleeding at the end of the procedure. Vaseline gauze, Telfa, and Elastoplast dressing was applied. The stay-stitch was removed and pressure held until bleeding stopped. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned to the recovery room in stable condition."
13,Urology,"CIRCUMCISION - NEONATALPROCEDURE:: The procedure, risks and benefits were explained to the patient's mom, and a consent form was signed. She is aware of the risk of bleeding, infection, meatal stenosis, excess or too little foreskin removed and the possible need for revision in the future. The infant was placed on the papoose board. The external genitalia were prepped with Betadine. A penile block was performed with a 30-gauge needle and 1.5 mL of Nesacaine without epinephrine.Next, the foreskin was clamped at the 12 o'clock position back to the appropriate proximal extent of the circumcision on the dorsum of the penis. The incision was made. Next, all the adhesions of the inner preputial skin were broken down. The appropriate size bell was obtained and placed over the glans penis. The Gomco clamp was then configured, and the foreskin was pulled through the opening of the Gomco. The bell was then placed and tightened down. Prior to do this, the penis was viewed circumferentially, and there was no excess of skin gathered, particularly in the area of the ventrum. A blade was used to incise circumferentially around the bell. The bell was removed. There was no significant bleeding, and a good cosmetic result was evident with the appropriate amount of skin removed.Vaseline gauze was then placed. The little boy was given back to his mom.PLAN: They have a new baby checkup in the near future with their primary care physician. I will see them back on a p.r.n. basis if there are any problems with the circumcision."
14,Urology,CIRCUMCISIONAfter informed consent was obtained the baby was placed on the circumcision tray. He was prepped in a sterile fashion times 3 with Betadine and then draped in a sterile fashion. Then 0.2 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected at 10 and 2 o'clock. A ring block was also done using another 0.3 mL of lidocaine. Glucose water is also used for anesthesia. After several minutes the curved clamp was attached at 9 o'clock with care being taken to avoid the meatus. The blunt probe was then introduced again with care taken to avoid the meatus. After initial adhesions were taken down the straight clamp was introduced to break down further adhesions. Care was taken to avoid the frenulum. The clamps where then repositioned at 12 and 6 o'clock. The Mogen clamp was then applied with a dorsal tilt. After the clamp was applied for 1 minute the foreskin was trimmed. After an additional minute the clamp was removed and the final adhesions were taken down. Patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal bleeding noted. Patient to remain for 20 minutes after procedure to insure no further bleeding is noted.Routine care discussed with the family. Need to clean the area with just water initially and later with soap and water or diaper wipes once healed.
15,Urology,"The patient was placed in the supine position, prepped and draped in the usual manner. Circumferential proximal incisions were made on the foreskin and dissected down to the underlying tissue. Hemostasis was obtained with a needlepoint Bovie. The foreskin was dissected sharply off of the shaft of the penis. Hemostasis controlled. The proximal and distal penile coronal skin was reanastomosed using 4-0 chromic catgut in interrupted fashion. 0.25% Marcaine was used around the base of the penis for a pain block postoperatively and Vaseline soaked gauze wrapped around the penis loosely as a dressing.The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the Recovery Room in stable condition."
16,Urology,"PROCEDURES:1. Release of ventral chordee.2. Circumcision.3. Repair of partial duplication of urethral meatus.INDICATIONS: The patient is an 11-month-old baby boy who presented for evaluation of a duplicated urethral meatus as well as ventral chordee and dorsal prepuce hooding. He is here electively for surgical correction.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought back into operating room 35. After successful induction of general endotracheal anesthetic, giving the patient, preoperative antibiotics and after completing a preoperative time out, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.A holding stitch was placed in the glans penis. At this point, we probed both urethral meatus. Using the Crede maneuver, we could see urine clearly coming out of the lower, the more ventral meatus. At this point, we cannulated this with a 6-French hypospadias catheter. We attempted to cannulate the dorsal opening, however, we were unsuccessful. We then attempted to place lacrimal probes and were also unsuccessful indicating this was incomplete duplication. At this point, we identified the band connecting both the urethral meatus and incised it with tenotomy scissors. We sutured both meatus together such that there was one meatus at the normal position at the tip of the glans.At this point, we made a circumcising incision around the penis and degloved the penis in its entirety relieving all chordee. Once all the chordee had been adequately released, we turned our attention to the circumcision. Excessive dorsal foreskin was removed from the skin and glans. Mucosal cuts were reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 chromic suture. Dermabond was placed over this and bacitracin was placed on this once dry. This ended the procedure. DRAINS: None.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.URINE OUTPUT: Unrecorded.COMPLICATIONS: None apparent.DISPOSITION: The patient will now go under the care of Dr. XYZ, Plastic Surgery, for excision of scalp hemangioma."
17,Urology,"PROCEDURE: Circumcision.Signed informed consent was obtained and the procedure explained.DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: The child was placed in a Circumstraint board and restrained in the usual fashion. The area of the penis and scrotum were prepared with povidone iodine solution. The area was draped with sterile drapes, and the remainder of the procedure was done with sterile procedure. A dorsal penile block was done using 2 injections of 0.3 cc each, 1% plain lidocaine. A dorsal slit was made, and the prepuce was dissected away from the glans penis. A Gomco clamp was properly placed for 5 minutes. During this time, the foreskin was sharply excised using a #10 blade. With removal of the clamp, there was a good cosmetic outcome and no bleeding. The child appeared to tolerate the procedure well. Care instructions were given to the parents."
18,Urology,"PROCEDURE: Circumcision.ANESTHESIA: EMLA.FINDINGS: Normal penis. The foreskin was normal in appearance and measured 1.6 cm. There was no bleeding at the circumcision site.PROCEDURE: Patient was placed on the circumcision restraint board. EMLA had been applied approximately 90 minutes before. A time-out was completed satisfactorily per protocol. The area was prepped with Betadine. The foreskin was grasped with sterile clamps and was dissected away from the corona and the glans penis with blunt dissection. A Mogen clamp was applied to the cervix. The excess foreskin was excised with the scalpel. The clamp was removed. At this point, the procedure was terminated. Sterile Vaseline and gauze was applied to the glans penis. There were no complications. There was minimal blood loss."

20,Urology,"PROCEDURE: Circumcision.PRE-PROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Normal male phallus.POST-PROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Normal male phallus.ANESTHESIA: 1% lidocaine without epinephrine.INDICATIONS: The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the parents. The risks are infection, hemorrhage, and meatal stenosis. The benefits are ease of care and cleanliness and fewer urinary tract infections. The parents understand this and have signed a permit.FINDINGS: The infant is without evidence of hypospadias or chordee prior to the procedure.TECHNIQUE: The infant was given a dorsal penile block with 1% lidocaine without epinephrine using a tuberculin syringe and 0.5 cc of lidocaine was delivered subcutaneously at 10:30 and at 1:30 o'clock at the dorsal base of the penis.The infant was prepped then with Betadine and draped with a sterile towel in the usual manner. Clamps were placed at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock and the adhesions between the glans and mucosa were instrumentally lysed. Dorsal hemostasis was established and a dorsal slit was made. The foreskin was fully retracted and remaining adhesions between the glans and mucosa were manually lysed. The infant was fitted with a XX-cm Plastibell. The foreskin was retracted around the Plastibell and circumferential hemostasis was established. The excess foreskin was removed with scissors and the infant tolerated the procedure well with a minimum amount of blood loss. Instructions for continuing care are to watch for any evidence of hemorrhage or urination and the parents are instructed in the care of the circumcised penis."
21,Urology,"PROCEDURE: Newborn circumcision.INDICATIONS: Parental preference.ANESTHESIA: Dorsal penile nerve block.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The baby was prepared and draped in a sterile manner. Lidocaine 1% 4 mL without epinephrine was instilled into the base of the penis at 2 o'clock and 10 o'clock. The penile foreskin was removed using a XXX Gomco. Hemostasis was achieved with minimal blood loss. There was no sign of infection. The baby tolerated the procedure well. Vaseline was applied to the penis, and the baby was diapered by nursing staff."
22,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Phimosis and adhesions.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Phimosis and adhesions.PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Circumcision and release of ventral chordee.ANESTHESIA: Local MAC.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.FLUIDS: Crystalloid. The patient was given antibiotics preop.BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 43-year-old male who presented to us with significant phimosis, difficulty retracting the foreskin. The patient had buried penis with significant obesity issues in the suprapubic area. Options such as watchful waiting, continuation of slowly retracting the skin, applying betamethasone cream, and circumcision were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, and CVA risks were discussed. The patient had discussed this issue with Dr Khan and had been approved to get off of the Plavix. Consent had been obtained. Risk of scarring, decrease in penile sensation, and unexpected complications were discussed. The patient was told about removing the dressing tomorrow morning, okay to shower after 48 hours, etc. Consent was obtained.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in supine position. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Local MAC anesthesia was applied. After draping, 17 mL of mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain were applied around the dorsal aspect of the penis for dorsal block. The patient had significant phimosis and slight ventral chordee. Using marking pen, the excess foreskin was marked off. Using a knife, the ventral chordee was released. The urethra was intact. The excess foreskin was removed. Hemostasis was obtained using electrocautery. A 5-0 Monocryl stitches were used for 4 interrupted stitches and horizontal mattresses were done. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There was excellent hemostasis. The penis was straight. Vaseline gauze and Kerlix were applied. The patient was brought to the recovery in stable condition. Plan was for removal of the dressing tomorrow. Okay to shower after 48 hours."
23,Urology,"REASON FOR VISIT: Followup circumcision.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient had his circumcision performed on 09/16/2007 here at Children's Hospital. The patient had a pretty significant phimosis and his operative course was smooth. He did have a little bit of bleeding when he woke in recovery room, which required placement of some additional sutures, but after that, his recovery has been complete. His mom did note that she had to him a couple of days of oral analgesics, but he seems to be back to normal and pain free now. He is having no difficulty urinating, and his bowel function remains normal.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Today, The patient looks healthy and happy. We examined his circumcision site. His Monocryl sutures are still in place. The healing is excellent, and there is only a mild amount of residual postoperative swelling. There was one area where he had some recurrent adhesions at the coronal sulcus, and I gently lysed this today and applied antibiotic ointment showing this to mom had to especially lubricate this area until the healing is completed.IMPRESSION: Satisfactory course after circumcision for severe phimosis with no perioperative complications.PLAN: The patient came in followup for his routine care with Dr. X, but should not need any further routine surgical followup unless he develops any type of difficulty with this surgical wound. If that does occur, we will be happy to see him back at any time."
24,Urology,"CONSULT FOR PROSTATE CANCERThe patient returned for consultation for his newly diagnosed prostate cancer. The options including radical prostatectomy with or without nerve sparing were discussed with him with the risks of bleeding, infection, rectal injury, impotence, and incontinence. These were discussed at length. Alternative therapies including radiation therapy; either radioactive seed placement, conformal radiation therapy, or the HDR radiation treatments were discussed with the risks of bladder, bowel, and rectal injury and possible impotence were discussed also. There is a risk of rectal fistula. Hormonal therapy is usually added to the radiation therapy options and this has the risk of osteoporosis, gynecomastia, hot flashes and impotency. Potency may not recover after the hormone therapy has been completed. Cryosurgery was discussed with the risks of urinary retention, stricture formation, incontinence and impotency. There is a risk of rectal fistula. He would need to have a suprapubic catheter for about two weeks and may need to learn self-intermittent catheterization if he cannot void adequately. Prostate surgery to relieve obstruction and retention after radioactive seeds or cryosurgery has a higher risk of urinary incontinence. Observation therapy was discussed with him in addition. I answered all questions that were put to me and I think he understands the options that are available. I spoke with the patient for over 60 minutes concerning these options."
25,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carcinoma of the prostate, clinical stage T1C.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carcinoma of the prostate, clinical stage T1C.TITLE OF OPERATION: Cystoscopy, cryosurgical ablation of the prostate.FINDINGS: After measurement of the prostate, we decided to place 5 rows of needles--row #1 had 3 needles, row #2 at the level of the mid-prostate had 4 needles, row #3 had 2 needles in the right lateral peripheral zone, row #4 was a single needle directly the urethra, and in row #5 were 2 needles placed in the left lateral peripheral zone. Because of the length of the prostate, a pull-back was performed, pulling row #2 approximately 3 mm and rows #3, #4 and #5 approximately 1 cm back before refreezing.OPERATION IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the patient was positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position. Full bowel prep had been obtained prior to the procedure. After performing flexible cystoscopy, a Foley catheter was placed per urethra into the bladder. Next, the ultrasound probe was placed into the stabilizer and advanced into the rectum. An excellent ultrasound image was visualized of the entire prostate, which was re-measured. Next, the probe template was positioned over the perineum and the template guide brought up on the ultrasound screen in order to guide needle placement. Then 17-gauge needles were serially placed into the prostate, from an anterior to posterior direction into the prostate. Ultrasound guidance demonstrated that these needles, numbering approximately 14 to 15 needles, were well placed and spaced throughout the prostate to obtain excellent freezing of the entire gland while sparing the urethra. Repeat cystoscopy demonstrated a single needle passing through the urethra; and due to the high anterior location of this needle, it was removed. The CMS urethral warmer was then passed per urethra into the bladder, and flow instituted. After placing these 17-gauge needles, the prostate was then frozen down to minus 150 degrees for 10 minutes in sequential fashion from anterior to posterior. The ice ball was monitored and was seen to extend through the capsule of the prostate toward the rectum but not through the rectal wall itself. Active warming was then performed before refreezing the prostate again and then passively warming it back to room temperature. The urethral warmer was left on after the needles were removed and the patient brought to the recovery room. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in stable condition."
26,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right lower pole renal stone and possibly infected stent.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right lower pole renal stone and possibly infected stent.OPERATION: Cysto stent removal.ANESTHESIA: Local MAC.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.FLUIDS: Crystalloid.MEDICATIONS: The patient was on vancomycin and Levaquin was given x1 dose. The patient was on vancomycin for the last 5 days.BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 53-year-old female who presented with Enterococcus urosepsis. CT scan showed a lower pole stone with a stent in place. The stent was placed about 2 months ago, but when patient came in with a possibly UPJ stone with fevers of unknown etiology. The patient had a stent placed at that time due to the fevers, thinking that this was an urospetic stone. There was some pus that came out. The patient was cultured; actually it was negative at that time. The patient subsequently was found to have lower extremity DVT and then was started on Coumadin. The patient cannot be taken off Coumadin for the next 6 months due to the significant swelling and high risk for PE. The repeat films were taken which showed the stone had migrated into the pole.The stent was intact. The patient subsequently developed recurrent UTIs and Enterococcus in the urine with fevers. The patient was admitted for IV antibiotics since the patient could not really tolerate penicillin due to allergy and due to patient being on Coumadin, Cipro, and Levaquin where treatment was little bit more complicated. Due to drug interaction, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotic treatment. The thinking was that either the stone or the stent is infected, since the stone is pretty small in size, the stent is very likely possibility that it could have been infected and now it needs to be removed. Since the stone is not obstructing, there is no reason to replace the stent at this time. We are unable to do the ureteroscopy or the shock-wave lithotripsy when the patient is fully anticoagulated. So, the best option at this time is to probably wait and perform the ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy when the patient is allowed to off her Coumadin, which would be probably about 4 months down the road.Plan is to get rid of the stent and improve patient's urinary symptoms and to get rid of the infection and we will worry about the stone at later point.DETAILS OF THE OR: Consent had been obtained from the patient. Risks, benefits, and options were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed. The patient understood all the risks and benefits of removing the stent and wanted to proceed. The patient was brought to the OR. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was given some IV pain meds. The patient had received vancomycin and Levaquin preop. Cystoscopy was performed using graspers. The stent was removed without difficulty. Plan was for repeat cultures and continuation of the IV antibiotics."
27,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Prostatism.2. Bladder calculus.OPERATION: Holmium laser cystolithalopaxy.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Prostatism.2. Bladder calculus.ANESTHESIA: General.INDICATIONS: This is a 62-year-old male diabetic and urinary retention with apparent neurogenic bladder and intermittent self-catheterization, recent urinary tract infections. The cystoscopy showed a large bladder calculus, short but obstructing prostate. He comes in now for transurethral resection of his prostate and holmium laser cystolithotripsy.He is a diabetic with obesity.LABORATORY DATA: Includes urinalysis showing white cells too much to count, 3-5 red cells, occasional bacteria. He had a serum creatinine of 1.2, sodium 138, potassium 4.6, glucose 190, calcium 9.1. Hematocrit 40.5, hemoglobin 13.8, white count 7,900.PROCEDURE: The patient was satisfactorily given general anesthesia. Prepped and draped in the dorsal lithotomy position. A 27-French Olympus rectoscope was passed via the urethra into the bladder. The bladder, prostate, and urethra were inspected. He had an obstructing prostate. He had marked catheter reaction in his bladder. He had a lot of villous changes, impossible to tell from frank tumor. He had a huge bladder calculus. It was white and round.I used the holmium laser with the largest fiber through the continuous flow resectoscope and sheath, and broke up the stone, breaking up approximately 40 grams of stone. There was still stone left at the end of the procedure. Most of the chips that could be irrigated out of the bladder were irrigated out using Ellik.Then the scope was removed and a 24-French 3-way Foley catheter was passed via the urethra into the bladder.The plan is to probably discharge the patient in the morning and then we will get a KUB. We will probably bring him back for a second stage cystolithotripsy, and ultimately do a TURP. We broke up the stone for over an hour, and my judgment continuing with litholapaxy transurethrally over an hour begins to markedly increase the risk to the patient."
28,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Clinical stage T2, NX, MX transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder, status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy.2. New right hydronephrosis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Clinical stage T4a, N3, M1 transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder, status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy.2. New right hydronephrosis.3. Carcinoid tumor of the small bowel.TITLE OF OPERATION: Exploratory laparotomy, resection of small bowel lesion, biopsy of small bowel mesentery, bilateral extended pelvic and iliac lymphadenectomy (including preaortic and precaval, bilateral common iliac, presacral, bilateral external iliac lymph nodes), salvage radical cystoprostatectomy (very difficult due to previous chemotherapy and radiation therapy), and continent urinary diversion with an Indiana pouch.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal and epidural.INDICATIONS: This patient is a 65-year-old white male, who was diagnosed with a high-grade invasive bladder cancer in June 2005. During the course of his workup of transurethral resection, he had a heart attack when he was taken off Plavix after having had a drug-eluting stent placed in. He recovered from this and then underwent chemotherapy and radiation therapy with a brief response documented by cystoscopy and biopsy after which he had another ischemic event. The patient has been followed regularly by myself and Dr. X and has been continuously free of diseases since that time. In that interval, he had a coronary artery bypass graft and was taken off of Plavix. Most recently, he had a PET CT, which showed new right hydronephrosis and a followup cystoscopy, which showed a new abnormality in the right side of his bladder where he previously had the tumor resected and treated. I took him to the operating room and extensively resected this area with findings of a high-grade muscle invasive bladder cancer. We could not identify the right ureteral orifice, and he had a right ureteral stent placed. Metastatic workup was negative and Cardiology felt he was at satisfactory medical risk for surgery and he was taken to the operating room this time for planned salvage cystoprostatectomy. He was interested in orthotopic neobladder, and I felt like that would be reasonable if resecting around the urethra indicated the tissue was healthier. Therefore, we planned on an Indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion.OPERATIVE FINDINGS: On exploration, there were multiple abnormalities outside the bladder as follows: There were at least three small lesions within the distal small bowel, the predominant one measured about 1.5 cm in diameter with a white scar on the surface. There were two much smaller lesions also with a small white scar, with very little palpable mass. The larger of the two was resected and found to be a carcinoid tumor. There also were changes in the small bowel mesentry that looked inflammatory and biopsies of this showed only fibrous tissue and histiocytes. The small bowel mesentry was fairly thickened at the base, but no discrete abnormality noted.Both common iliac and lymph node samples were very thickened and indurated, and frozen section of the left showed cancer cells that were somewhat degenerative suggesting a chemotherapy and radiation therapy effect; viability was unable to be determined. There was a frozen section of the distal right external iliac lymph node that was negative. The bladder was very thickened and abnormal suggesting extensive cancer penetrating just under the peritoneal surface. The bladder was fairly stuck to the pelvic sidewall and anterior symphysis pubis requiring very meticulous resection in order to get it off of these structures. The external iliac lymph nodes were resected on both sides of the obturator; the lymph packet, however, was very stuck and adherent to the pelvic sidewall, and I elected not to remove that. The rest of the large bowel appeared normal. There were no masses in the liver, and the gallbladder was surgically absent. There was nasogastric tube in the stomach.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the operative suite, and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, having placed in the supine position and flexed over the anterior superior iliac spine, his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion. The radiologist placed a radial arterial line and an intravenous catheter. Intravenous antibiotics were given for prophylaxis. We made a generous midline skin incision from high end of the epigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deepened through the rectus fascia, and the rectus muscles separated in the midline. Exploration was carried out with the findings described. The bladder was adherent and did appear immobile. Moist wound towels and a Bookwalter retractor was placed for exposure. We began by assessing the small and large bowel with the findings in the small bowel as described. We subsequently resected the largest of the lesions by exogenous wedge resection and reanastomosed the small bowel with a two-layer running 4-0 Prolene suture. We then mobilized the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure after incising the white line of Toldt and mobilized the terminal ileal mesentery up to the second and third portion of the duodenum. The ureters were carefully dissected out and down deep in the true pelvis. The right ureter was thickened and hydronephrotic with a stent in place and the left was of normal caliber. I kept the ureters intact until we were moving the bladder off as described above. At that point, we then ligated the ureters with the RP-45 vascular load and divided it.We then established the proximal ____________ laterally to both genitofemoral nerves and resected the precaval and periaortic lymph nodes. The common iliac lymph nodes remained stuck to the ureter. Frozen section with the findings described on the left.I then began the dissection over the right external iliac artery and vein and had a great deal of difficulty dissecting distally. I was, however, able to establish the distal plane of dissection and a large lymph node was present in the distal external iliac vessels. Clips were used to control the lymphatics distally. These lymph nodes were sent for frozen section, which was negative. We made no attempt to circumferentially mobilize the vessels, but essentially, swept the tissue off of the anterior surface and towards the bladder and then removed it. The obturator nerve on the right side was sucked into the pelvic sidewall, and I elected not to remove those. On the left side, things were a little bit more mobile in terms of the lymph nodes, but still the obturator lymph nodes were left intact.We then worked on the lateral pedicles on both sides and essentially determined that I can take these down. I then mobilized the later half of the symphysis pubis and pubic ramus to get distal to the apical prostate. At this point, I scrubbed out of the operation, talked to the family, and indicated that I felt the cystectomy was more palliative than therapeutic, and I reiterated his desire to be free of any external appliance.I then proceeded to take down the lateral pedicles with an RP-45 stapler on the right and clips distally. The endopelvic fascia was incised. I then turned my attention posteriorly and incised the peritoneum overlying the anterior rectal wall and ramus very meticulously dissected the rectum away from the posterior Denonvilliers fascia. I intentionally picked down those two pedicles lateral to the rectum between the clips and then turned my attention retropubically. I was able to pass a 0 Vicryl suture along the dorsal venous complex, tied this, and then, sealed and divided the complex with a LigaSure and oversewed it distally with 2-0 Vicryl figure-of-eight stitch. I then divided the urethra distal to the apex of the prostate, divided the Foley catheter between the clamps and then the posterior urethra. I then was able to take down the remaining distal attachments of the apex and took the dissection off the rectum, and the specimen was then free of all attachments and handed off the operative field. The bivalved prostate appeared normal. We then carefully inspected the rectal wall and noted to be intact. The wound was irrigated with 1 L of warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection made for hemostasis and a dry pack placed in the pelvis.We then turned our attention to forming the Indiana pouch. I completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon. The colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a GIA-80 stapler. I then divided the avascular plane of Treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum. The mesentery was then sealed with a LigaSure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a GIA-60 stapler. We then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a GIA-80 stapler, closing the open end with a TA 60. The angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures.We then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-French Robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the GIA-60 stapler. The ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by Rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-French Robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic ""pop,"" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve.As the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy. We then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 Vicryl sutures. The bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the SGIA Polysorb-75. Between the staple lines, Vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture ligatures.We then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis. The left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a Cook 8.4-French ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture. The right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis. We then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture. A 24-French Malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture. The staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 Vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a TA 60 Polysorb suture. The pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact.We then made a final inspection for hemostasis. The cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures. We then matured our stoma through the umbilicus. We removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this. A portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures. We left an 18-French Robinson through the stoma and secured this to the skin with silk sutures. The Malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion.The stoma was returned to the umbilicus after resecting the terminal ileum.We then placed a large JP drain into both obturator fossae and brought it up the right lower quadrant. Rectus fascia was closed with buried #2 Prolene stitch anchoring a new figure of 8 at each end tying the two stitches above and in the middle and underneath the fascia. Interrupted stitches were placed as well. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and skin closed with surgical clips. The estimated blood loss was 2500 mL. The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells and 4 units of FFP. The patient was then awakened, extubated, and taken on a stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."
29,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal ureteral stone.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal ureteral stone.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Cystopyelogram, left ureteroscopy, laser lithotripsy, stone basket extraction, stent exchange with a string attached.ANESTHESIA: LMA.EBL: Minimal.FLUIDS: Crystalloid. The patient was given antibiotics, 1 g of Ancef and the patient was on oral antibiotics at home.BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 61-year-old female with history of recurrent uroseptic stones. The patient had stones x2, 1 was already removed, second one came down, had recurrent episode of sepsis, stent was placed. Options were given such as watchful waiting, laser lithotripsy, shockwave lithotripsy etc. Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, need for stent, and removal of the stent were discussed. The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure.DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A 0.035 glidewire was placed in the left system. Using graspers, left-sided stent was removed. A semirigid ureteroscopy was done. A stone was visualized in the mid to upper ureter. Using laser, the stone was broken into 5 to 6 small pieces. Using basket extraction, all the pieces were removed. Ureteroscopy all the way up to the UPJ was done, which was negative. There were no further stones. Using pyelograms, the rest of the system appeared normal. The entire ureter on the left side was open and patent. There were no further stones. Due to the edema and the surgery, plan was to leave the stent attached to the string and the patient was to pull the string in about 24 hours. Over the 0.035 glidewire, a 26 double-J stent was placed. There was a nice curl in the kidney and one in the bladder. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Please note that the string was kept in place and the patient was to remove the stent the next day. The patient's family was instructed how to do so. The patient had antibiotics and pain medications at home. The patient was brought to recovery room in a stable condition."
30,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gross hematuria.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gross hematuria.OPERATIONS: Cystopyelogram, clot evacuation, transurethral resection of the bladder tumor x2 on the dome and on the left wall of the bladder.ANESTHESIA: Spinal.FINDINGS: Significant amount of bladder clots measuring about 150 to 200 mL, two cupful of clots were removed. There was papillary tumor on the left wall right at the bladder neck and one on the right dome near the bladder neck on the right side. The right ureteral opening was difficult to visualize, the left one was normal.BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 78-year-old male with history of gross hematuria and recurrent UTIs. The patient had hematuria. Cystoscopy revealed atypical biopsy. The patient came in again with gross hematuria. The first biopsy was done about a month ago. The patient was to come back and have repeat biopsies done, but before that came into the hospital with gross hematuria. The options of watchful waiting, removal of the clots and biopsies were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT and PE were discussed. Morbidity and mortality of the procedure were discussed. Consent was obtained from the daughter-in-law who has the power of attorney in Florida.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The patient had been off of the Coumadin for about 4 days and INR had been reversed. The patient has significant amount of clot upon entering the bladder. There was a tight bladder neck contracture. The prostate was not enlarged. Using ACMI 24-French sheath, using Ellick irrigation about 2 cupful of clots were removed. It took about half an hour to just remove the clots. After removing the clots, using 24-French cutting loop resectoscope, tumor on the left upper wall near the dome or near the 2 o'clock position was resected. This was lateral to the left ureteral opening. The base was coagulated for hemostasis. Same thing was done at 10 o'clock on the right side where there was some tumor that was visualized. The back wall and the rest of the bladder appeared normal. Using 8-French cone-tip catheter, left-sided pyelogram was normal. The right-sided pyelogram was very difficult to obtain and there was some mucosal irritation from the clots. The contrast did go up to what appeared to be the right ureteral opening, but the mucosa seemed to be very much irritated and it was very difficult to actually visualize the opening. A little bit of contrast went out, but the force was not made just to avoid any secondary stricture formation. The patient did have CT with contrast, which showed that the kidneys were normal. At this time, a #24 three-way irrigation was started. The patient was brought to Recovery room in stable condition."

Right ureteral orifice was HIT with 1.5 mL of Deflux and left with 1.2 mL of Deflux.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 4-1/2-year-old boy with history of reflux nephropathy and voiding and bowel dysfunction. He has had a STING procedure performed but continues to have reflux bilaterally. Plan is for another injection.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, IV antibiotics were given. He was then placed in a lithotomy position with adequate padding of his arms and legs. His urethra was calibrated to 12-French with a bougie a boule. A 9.5-French cystoscope was used and the offset system was then used. His urethra was normal without valves or strictures. His bladder was fairly normal with minimal trabeculations but no cystitis noted. Upon evaluation, the patient's right ureteral orifice was found to be remarkably gaping and the Deflux that was present was not in or near ureteral orifice but it was inferior to it below the trigone. This was similarly found on the left side where the Deflux was not close to the orifice as well. It was slightly more difficult because of the amount impacted upon our angle for injection. We were able to ultimately get the Deflux to go ahead with HIT technique on the right into the ureter itself to inject a total of 1.5 mL to include the HIT technique as well as the ureteral orifice itself on the right and left sides and some on the uppermost aspect. Once we injected this, we ran the irrigant over the orifice and it no longer fluttered and there was no bleeding. Similar procedure was done on the left. This was actually more difficult as the Deflux injection from before displaced the ureter slightly more laterally but again HIT technique was performed. There was some mild bleeding and Deflux was used to stop this as well and again no evidence of fluttering of the ureteral orifice after injection. At the end of the procedure, the irrigant was drained and 2% lidocaine jelly was instilled in the urethra. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was in stable condition upon transfer to Recovery. A low-dose of IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure as well."

He was then placed in dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in standard fashion. A #21 French cystoscope was then used to visualized the entire urethra and bladder. There was noted to be a narrowing of the proximal urethra, however, the scope was able to pass through. The patient was noted to have a previously resected prostate. On visualization of the bladder, the patient did have areas of erythema on the right as well as the left lateral walls, more significant on the right side. The patient did have increased vascularity throughout the bladder. The ________ two biopsies of the right lateral wall and those were sent for pathology. The Bovie cautery was then used to cauterize the entire area of the biopsy as well as surrounding erythema. Bovie was also utilized to cauterize the areas of erythema on the left lateral wall. No further bleeding was identified. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room.He will have his defibrillator restarted and will followup with Dr. X in approximately two weeks for the result. He will be discharged home with antibiotics as well as pain medications. He is to restart his Coumadin not before Sunday."

Inability to pass a Foley catheter x3.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Ta grade III TIS transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder.2. Lower tract outlet obstructive symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy.3. Inability to pass a Foley catheter x3.PROCEDURES:1. Cystoscopy.2. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).ANESTHESIA: General laryngeal mask.INDICATIONS: This patient is a 61-year-old white male who has been treated at the VA in Houston for a bladder cancer. His history dates back to 2003 when he had a non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. He had multiple cystoscopies and followups since that time with no evidence of recurrence. However, on recent cystoscopy, he had what appeared to be a recurrent tumor and was taken to the operating room and had this resected with findings of a Ta grade III transitional cell carcinoma associated with carcinoma in situ. Retrograde pyelograms were suspicious on the right and cleared with ureteroscopy and the left renal pelvic washing was positive but this may represent contamination from the lower urinary tract as radiographically, there were no abnormalities. I had cystoscoped the patient in the office showed during the period of time when he had significant irritative burning symptoms, and there were still healing biopsy sites. We elected to allow his bladder to recover before starting the BCG. We were ready to do that last week but two doctors and a nurse including myself were unable to pass Foley catheter. I repeated a cystoscopy in the office with findings of a high bladder neck and BPH. After a lengthy discussion with the patient and his wife, we elected to proceed with TURP after a full informed consent.FINDINGS: At cystoscopy, there was bilobular prostatic hyperplasia and a very high riding bladder neck, which may have been the predominant cause of his difficulty catheterizing and obstructive symptoms. There were mucosal changes on the left posterior wall in the midline suspicious for carcinoma in situ.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the cystoscopy suite and after adequate general laryngeal mask anesthesia obtained and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position, his perineum and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A cystourethroscopy was performed with a #23 French ACMI panendoscope and 70-degree lens with the findings as described. We removed the cystoscope and passed a #28 French continuous flow resectoscope sheath under visual obturator after dilating the meatus to #32 French with van Buren sounds. Inspection of bladder again was made noting the location of the ureteral orifices relative to the bladder neck. The groove was cut at 6 o'clock to open the bladder neck to verumontanum and then the left lobe was resected from 1 o'clock to 5 o'clock. Hemostasis was achieved, and then a similar procedure performed in the right side. We resected the anterior stromal tissue and the apical tissue and then obtained complete hemostasis. Chips were removed with Ellik evacuator. There was no bleeding at the conclusion of the procedure, and the resectoscope was removed. A #24 French three-way Foley catheter was placed with efflux of clear irrigant. The patient was returned to the supine position, awakened, extubated, and taken on a stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."
34,Urology,"CYSTOSCOPY & VISUAL URETHROTOMYOPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the usual manner under satisfactory general anesthesia. A Storz urethrotome sheath was inserted into the urethra under direct vision. Visualization revealed a stricture in the bulbous urethra. This was intubated with a 0.038 Teflon-coated guidewire, and using the straight cold urethrotomy knife, it was incised to 12:00 to allow free passage of the scope into the bladder. Visualization revealed no other lesions in the bulbous or membranous urethra. Prostatic urethra was normal for age. No foreign bodies, tumors or stones were seen within the bladder. Over the guidewire, a #16-French Foley catheter with a hole cut in the tip with a Cook cutter was threaded over the guidewire and inserted into the bladder and inflated with 10 mL of sterile water.He was sent to the recovery room in stable condition."

Bilateral retrograde ureteropyelograms.3. Right ureteral barbotage for urine cytology.4. Right ureterorenoscopy, diagnostic.ANESTHESIA: Spinal.SPECIMEN TO PATHOLOGY: Urine and saline wash barbotage from right ureter through the ureteral catheter.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 70-year-old female who reports progressive intermittent right flank pain associated with significant discomfort and disability. She presented to the emergency room where she was found to have significant hydronephrosis on the right without evidence of a stone. She has some ureteral thickening in her distal right ureter. She has persistent microscopic hematuria and her urine cytology and cytomolecular diagnosis significant for urothelial dysplasia with neoplasia-associated karyotypic profile. She was brought to the operating room for further evaluation and treatment.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: After preoperative counseling, the patient was taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthesia. She was placed in the lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The 21-French cystoscope was inserted per urethra into the bladder. The bladder was inspected and found to be without evidence of intravesical tumors, stones or mucosal abnormalities. The right ureteral orifice was visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter. This was gently advanced to the mid ureter. Urine was collected for cytology. Retrograde injection of saline through the ureteral catheter was then also used to enhance collection of the specimen. This too was collected and sent for a pooled urine cytology as specimen from the right renal pelvis and ureter. An 0.038 guidewire was then passed up through the open-ended ureteral catheter. The open-ended ureteral catheter and cystoscope were removed, and over the guidewire the flexible ureteroscope was passed up to the level of the renal pelvis. Using direct vision and fluoroscopy to confirm location, the entire renal pelvis and calyces were inspected. The renal pelvis demonstrated an extrarenal pelvis, but no evidence of obstruction at the renal UPJ level. There were no intrapelvic or calyceal stones. The ureter demonstrated no significant mucosal abnormalities, no visible tumors, and no areas of apparent constriction on multiple passes of the ureteroscope through the ureter to evaluate. The ureteroscope was then removed. The cystoscope was reinserted. Once again, retrograde injection of contrast through an open-ended ureteral catheter was undertaken in the right ureter and collecting system. No evidence of extravasation or significant change in anatomy was visualized. The left ureteral orifice was then visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter, and retrograde injection of contrast demonstrated a normal left ureter and collecting system. The cystoscope was removed. Foley catheter was inserted. The patient was placed in the supine position and transferred to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."

Cystourethroscopy.2. Bilateral retrograde pyelogram.3. Transurethral resection of bladder tumor of 1.5 cm in size.ANESTHESIA: IV general.SPECIMEN: UA for culture and cytology as well as the resecting bladder tumor specimen.INDICATIONS: This is a 52-year-old white female with a history of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with previous transurethral resection of the bladder, low grade. The patient had on serial cystoscopy evidence of recurrent bladder tumor at the right posterior wall. CT and IVP were performed and there was some question at the distal ureters. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient. The informed consent was on the chart at the time of procedure.PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient did receive Levaquin antibiotics prior to the procedure. She was then wheeled to the Operative Suite and general anesthetic was administered. She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and placed in a dorsal lithotomy position. Next, with a #21 French cystoscope, cystourethroscopy was performed. Upon entering the bladder, the urethra was noted to be free of any stones, strictures, diverticulum, or calculi. The bladder was then surveyed. The trigone appeared normal. The ureteral orifices were in normal location and noted efflux of clear yellow urine.The reminder of the bladder was then surveyed. There were some areas of blanched scar tissue from previous resection. Of note, there was a exophytic bladder tumor on the right posterior wall approximately 1.5 cm in diameter. There was no other evidence of recurrent disease, strictures, or calculi. Next, with a #6 French open-ended ureteral catheter, right retrograde pyelogram was performed. The right ureter was noted to uptake contrast freely and there was no evidence of stone, stricture, diverticulum, calculi or filling defects along the entire course of the ureter including the pelvicaliceal system. The catheter was removed and inserted into the left ureteral orifice and once again this appeared to be entirely normal left collecting system with no evidence of stone, stricture, diverticulum, filling defect or other tumor. The bladder was drained and irrigant was switched to glycine and then using the #26 French resectoscope this was assembled and passed into the bladder via the visual obturator. After entering the bladder, the EndoSheath equipped with a _______ resection loop was inserted. The power settings were set at 100 cut and 40 coag and the bladder tumor of the right posterior wall was then resected in its entirety and the entire tumor bed and lateral margins were then fulgurated with cautery. There was no evidence of tumor at the end of the resection. The specimens were collected and then passed off for pathological evaluation. The bladder was then drained and the procedure was terminated. The plan would be for the patient to be discharged home with Levaquin, Urised, and Vicodin. She is to follow up with Dr. X on 09/12/03 at 02:30 p.m. where we will review the pathology and possibly discuss BCG rather intravesical agent being the recurrent nature of this disease."

Right double-J 4.5 x 26 mm ureteral stent placement.ANESTHESIA: Sedation.SPECIMEN: Urine for cytology and culture sensitivity, right renal pelvis urine for cytology, and right upper pole biopsies.INDICATION: The patient is a 74-year-old male who was initially seen in the office with hematuria. He was then brought to the hospital for other medical problems and found to still have hematuria. He has a CAT scan with abnormal appearing right kidney and it was felt that he will benefit from cystoscope evaluation.PROCEDURE: After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. He was given IV sedation and placed in dorsal lithotomy position. He was then prepped and draped in the standard fashion. A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through his ureter on which patient was noted to have a hypospadias and passed through across the ends of the bladder. The patient was noted to have mildly enlarged prostate, however, it was non-obstructing.Upon visualization of the bladder, the patient was noted to have some tuberculation to the bladder. There were no masses or any other abnormalities noted other than the tuberculation. Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and an open-end of the catheter was then passed into the right ureteral orifice. A retrograde pyelogram was performed. Upon visualization, there was no visualization of the upper collecting system on the right side. At this point, a guidewire was then passed through the open-end of the ureteral catheter and the catheter was removed. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The rigid ureteroscope was then passed into the bladder and into the right ureteral orifice with the assistance of a second glidewire. The ureteroscope was taken all the way through the proximal ureter just below the UPJ and there were noted to be no gross abnormalities. The ureteroscope was removed and an Amplatz wire then passed through the scope up into the collecting system along the side of the previous wire. The ureteroscope was removed and a ureteral dilating sheath was passed over the Amplatz wire into the right ureter under fluoroscopic guidance. The Amplatz wire was then removed and the flexible ureteroscope was passed through the sheath into the ureter. The ureteroscope was passed up to the UPJ at which point there was noted to be difficulty entering the ureter due to UPJ obstruction. The wire was then again passed through the flexible scope and the flexible scope was removed. A balloon dilator was then passed over the wire and the UPJ was dilated with balloon dilation. The dilator was then removed and again the cystoscope was passed back up into the right ureter and was able to enter the collecting system. Upon visualization of the collecting system of the upper portion, there was noted to be papillary mass within the collecting system. The ________ biopsy forceps were then passed through the scope and two biopsies were taken of the papillary mass. Once this was done, the wire was left in place and the ureteroscope was removed. The cystoscope was then placed back into the bladder and a 26 x 4.5 mm ureteral stent was passed over the wire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance into the right renal pelvis. The stent was noted to be clear within the right renal pelvis as well as in the bladder. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. He will be transferred to the recovery room and back to his room. It has been discussed with his primary physician that the patient will likely need a nephrectomy. He will be scheduled for an echocardiogram tomorrow and then decision will be made where the patient will be stable for possible nephrectomy on Wednesday."

He stated that he never had blood in his urine before, however, he does have a past history of BPH and he had a transurethral resection of prostate more than 10 years ago. He was admitted to a regular bed. Dr. G of Urology was consulted for evaluation of his hematuria. During the workup for this, he had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast with early and late-phase imaging for evaluation of the kidneys and collecting system. At that time, he was shown to have multiple bilateral renal cysts with one that did not meet classification as a simple cyst and ultrasound was recommended.He had an ultrasound done of the cyst which showed a 2.1 x 2.7 cm mass arising from the right kidney which, again, did not fit ultrasound criteria for a simple cyst and they recommended further evaluation by an MRI as this could be a hemorrhagic cyst or a solid mass or tumor, so an MRI was scheduled on the day of discharge for further evaluation of this. The report was not back at discharge. The patient had a cystoscopy and transurethral resection of prostate as well with entire resection of the prostate gland. Pathology on this specimen showed multiple portions of prostatic tissue which was primarily fibromuscular, and he was diagnosed with nonprostatic hyperplasia. His urine slowly cleared. He tolerated a regular diet with no difficulties in his activities of daily living, and his Foley was removed on the day of discharge.He was started on ciprofloxacin, Colace, and Lasix after the transurethral resection and continued these for a short course. He is asked to continue the Colace as an outpatient for stool softening for comfort.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Colace 100 mg 1 b.i.d.DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP PLANNING: The patient is to follow up with his primary care physician at ABCD, Dr. B or Dr. J, the patient is unsure of which, in the next couple weeks. He is to follow up with Dr. G of Urology in the next week by phone in regards to the patient's MRI and plans for a laparoscopic partial renal resection biopsy. This is scheduled for the week after discharge potentially by Dr. G, and the patient will discuss the exact time later this week. The patient is to return to the emergency room or to our clinic if he has worsening hematuria again or no urine output."

He had a fever at first time with elevated creatinine. He was also evaluated and treated by Dr. X, for fluid management, hypertensive management, and gave him some hydralazine and Lasix to improve his urine output, in addition to manage his blood pressure. Once the percutaneous tube was placed, we found that his urine culture grew Pseudomonas, so he was kept on Fortaz, and was switched over to ciprofloxacin without difficulty. He, otherwise, did well with continuing decrease his creatinine at the time of discharge to home.The patient was discharged home in stable condition with ciprofloxacin, enalapril, and recommendation for followup in Urology in 1 to 2 weeks for the surgical correction in 2 to 3 weeks of repeat pyeloplasty or possible ureterocalicostomy.

Consent was obtained.DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient had a Foley catheter placed sterilely. The scrotum was taped up using Ioban. Transrectal ultrasound was done. The prostate was measured 15 g. Multiple images were taken. A volume study was done. This was given to the physicist, Dr. X was present who is radiation oncologist who helped with implanting of the seeds. Total of 38 seeds were placed in the patient with 10 peripheral needles and then 4 internal needles. Total of 30 seeds were placed in the periphery and total of 8 seeds were placed in the inside. They were done directly under transrectal ultrasound vision. The seeds were placed directly under ultrasound guidance. There was a nice distribution of the seeds. A couple of more seeds were placed on the right side due to the location of the prostate cancer. Subsequently at the end of the procedure, fluoroscopy was done. Couple of images were obtained. Cystoscopy was done at the end of the procedure where a seed was visualized right in the urethra, which was grasped and pulled out using grasper, which was difficult to get the seed off of the spacers, which was actually pulled out. There were no further seeds visualized in the bladder. The bladder appeared normal. At the end of the procedure, a Foley catheter was kept in place of 18 French and the patient was brought to recovery in stable condition."

The patient had hematuria, and unable to void. The patient had a Foley catheter, which was not in the urethra, possibly inflated in the prostatic urethra, which was removed. Foley catheter was repositioned 18 Coude was used. About over a liter of fluids of urine was obtained with light pink urine, which was irrigated. The bladder and the suprapubic area returned to normal after the Foley placement. The patient had some evidence of clots upon irrigation. The patient has had a chest CT, which showed possible atelectasis versus pneumonia.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Parkinson's, and CHF.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.SOCIAL HISTORY: Married and lives with wife.HABITS: No smoking or drinking.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Denies any chest pain, denies any seizure disorder, denies any nausea, vomiting. Does have suprapubic tenderness and difficulty voiding. The patient denies any prior history of hematuria, dysuria, burning, or pain.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: The patient is afebrile. Vitals are stable.GENERAL: The patient is a thin gentlemanGENITOURINARY: Suprapubic area was distended and bladder was palpated very easily. Prostate was 1+. Testes are normal.LABORATORY DATA: The patient's white counts are 20,000. Creatinine is normal.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:1. Pneumonia.2. Dehydration.3. Retention.4. BPH.5. Diabetes.6. Hyperlipidemia.7. Parkinson's.8. Congestive heart failure.About 30 minutes were spent during the procedure and the Foley catheter was placed, Foley was irrigated and significant amount of clots were obtained. Plan is for urine culture, antibiotics. Plan is for renal ultrasound to rule out any pathology. The patient will need cystoscopy and evaluation of the prostate. Apparently, the patient's PSA is 0.45, so the patient is at low to no risk of prostate cancer at this time. Continued Foley catheter at this point. We will think about starting the patient on alpha-blockers once the patient's over all medical condition is improved and stable."
60,Urology,"Thank you for allowing me to help in the evaluation of the patient who, as you know, is a 44-year-old male with a history of a skin lesion for approximately one year now. It has been given a label in the past of a skin tag. The patient states it is not painful, has had no trauma or bleeding to that area. The patient is interested in evaluation because he is on the move with his work and would like it taken care of.He has no voiding complaints and no history of sexually transmitted diseases.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: None.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Back surgery with a fusion of L5-S1.MEDICATIONS: He does take occasional Percocet for his back discomfort.ALLERGIES: HE HAS NO ALLERGIES.SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a smoker. He takes rare alcohol. His employment is that he does dynamite work and actually putting in the dynamite in large holes for destroying ground to that pipeline can be laid. He travels to anywhere for his work. He is married with one son.FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for prostate cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, enlarged prostate or kidney disease.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for tremors, headaches, dizzy spells, numbness, tingling, feeling hot or cold, tired or sluggishness, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, indigestion, heartburn, fevers, chills, weight loss, wheezing, frequent cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, varicose veins, high blood pressure, skin rash, joint pain, ear infections, sore throat, sinus problems, hay fever, blood clotting problems, depressive affect or eye problems.PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONGENERAL: The patient is afebrile. His vital signs are stable. He is 177 pounds, 5 feet, 8 inches. Blood pressure 144/66. He is healthy appearing. He is alert and oriented x 3.HEART: Regular rate and rhythm.LUNGS: Clear to auscultation.ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender. His penis is circumcised. He has a pedunculated cauliflower-like lesion on the dorsum of the penis at approximately 12 o'clock. It is very obvious and apparent. He also has a mildly raised brown lesion that the patient states has been there ever since he can remember and has not changed in size or caliber. His testicles are descended bilaterally. There are no masses.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is likely molluscum contagiosum (genital warts) caused by HPV. I did state to the patient that this is likely a viral infection that could have had a long incubation period. It is not clear where this came from but it is most likely sexually transmitted. He is instructed that he should use protected sex from this point on in order to try and limit the transmission. Regarding the actual lesion itself, I did mention that we could apply a cream of Condylox, which could take up to a month to work. I also offered him C02 laser therapy for the genital warts, which is an outpatient procedure. The patient is very interested in something quick and effective such as a CO2 laser procedure. I did state that the recurrence rate is significant and somewhere as high as 20% despite enucleating these lesions. The patient understood this and still wished to proceed. There is minimal risk otherwise except for those inherent in laser injury and accidental injury. The patient understood and wished to proceed."
61,Urology,"Under satisfactory general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the supine position and prepped and draped in the usual manner. A transverse inguinal skin crease incision was made and carried down through the skin to the external oblique aponeurosis. Hemostasis was obtained with Bovie. Care was taken to avoid any injury to the ilioinguinal nerve. The external oblique aponeurosis was identified and a small incision was made in the line of its fibers and extended with scissors, avoiding any nerve injury. The spermatic cord was dissected free of the shelving edge of the external oblique aponeurosis and dissected free from the surrounding tissue. The hernia sac and hydrocele were dissected free from the spermatic cord. The spermatic cord dropped back posteriorly without any injury to the vessels or vas. The hernia sac was divided, dissected free from the vessels going up into the internal ring. There were no contents within it. It was twisted and suture ligated with an interrupted suture of 3-0 silk. The hydrocele was opened and around the testicle appendix testis was present, was cauterized at its base with good hemostasis. The testicle was replaced back into the scrotum and felt to be in good position, both at this time and at the end of the procedure. The incision was then closed in layers using 3-0 Vicryl for the external oblique aponeurosis and subcutaneous tissue, and a running subcuticular closure of 4-0 Vicryl and Steri-Strips for the skin. 0.25% Marcaine without epinephrine was instilled below the skin for postoperative pain relief and he had a caudal block placed by Anesthesia. He was sent to the recovery room in stable condition."
62,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral hydroceles.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral hydroceles.PROCEDURE: Bilateral scrotal hydrocelectomies, large for both, and 0.5% Marcaine wound instillation, 30 mL given.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL.FLUIDS RECEIVED: 800 mL.TUBES AND DRAINS: A 0.25-inch Penrose drains x4.INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 17-year-old boy, who has had fairly large hydroceles noted for some time. Finally, he has decided to have them get repaired. Plan is for surgical repair.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, he was then shaved, prepped, and then sterilely prepped and draped. IV antibiotics were given. Ancef 1 g given. A scrotal incision was then made in the right hemiscrotum with a 15-blade knife and further extended with electrocautery. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis. Once we got to the hydrocele sac itself, we then opened and delivered the testis, drained clear fluid. There was moderate amount of scarring on the testis itself from the tunica vaginalis. It was then wrapped around the back and sutured in place with a running suture of 4-0 chromic in a Lord maneuver. Once this was done, a drain was placed in the base of the scrotum and then the testis was placed back into the scrotum in the proper orientation. A similar procedure was performed on the left, which has also had a hydrocele of the cord, which were both addressed and closed with Lord maneuver similarly. This testis also was normal but had moderate amount of scarring on the tunic vaginalis from this. A similar drain was placed. The testes were then placed back into the scrotum in a proper orientation, and the local wound instillation and wound block was then placed using 30 mL of 0.5% Marcaine without epinephrine. IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure. The skin was then sutured with a running interlocking suture of 3-0 Vicryl and the drains were sutured to place with 3-0 Vicryl. Bacitracin dressing, ABD dressing, and jock strap were placed. The patient was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room."
63,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bladder cancer and left hydrocele.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bladder cancer and left hydrocele.OPERATION: Left hydrocelectomy, cystopyelogram, bladder biopsy, and fulguration for hemostasis.ANESTHESIA: Spinal.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.FLUIDS: Crystalloid.BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 66-year-old male with history of smoking and hematuria, had bladder tumor, which was dissected. He has received BCG. The patient is doing well. The patient was supposed to come to the OR for surveillance biopsy and pyelograms. The patient had a large left hydrocele, which was increasingly getting worse and was making it very difficult for the patient to sit to void or put clothes on, etc. Options such as watchful waiting, drainage in the office, and hydrocelectomy were discussed. Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, infection in the scrotum, enlargement of the scrotum, recurrence, and pain were discussed. The patient understood all the options and wanted to proceed with the procedure.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.A transverse scrotal incision was made over the hydrocele sac and the hydrocele fluid was withdrawn. The sac was turned upside down and sutures were placed. Careful attention was made to ensure that the cord was open. The testicle was in normal orientation throughout the entire procedure. The testicle was placed back into the scrotal sac and was pexed with 4-0 Vicryl to the outside dartos to ensure that there was no risk of torsion. Orchiopexy was done at 3 different locations. Hemostasis was obtained using electrocautery. The sac was closed using 4-0 Vicryl. The sac was turned upside down so that when it heals, the fluid would not recollect. The dartos was closed using 2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl and Dermabond was applied. Incision measured about 2 cm in size. Subsequently using ACMI cystoscope, a cystoscopy was performed. The urethra appeared normal. There was some scarring at the bulbar urethra, but the scope went in through that area very easily into the bladder. There was a short prostatic fossa. The bladder appeared normal. There was some moderate trabeculation throughout the bladder, some inflammatory changes in the bag part, but nothing of much significance. There were no papillary tumors or stones inside the bladder. Bilateral pyelograms were obtained using 8-French cone-tip catheter, which appeared normal. A cold cup biopsy of the bladder was done and was fulgurated for hemostasis. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was brought to recovery at the end of the procedure after emptying the bladder.The patient was given antibiotics and was told to take it easy. No heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling. Plan was to follow up in about 2 months."
64,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left hydrocele.OPERATION: Left hydrocelectomy.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left hydrocele.ANESTHESIA: GeneralINDICATIONS AND STUDIES: This is a 67-year-old male with pain, left scrotum. He has had an elevated PSA and also has erectile dysfunction. He comes in now for a left hydrocelectomy. Physical exam confirmed obvious hydrocele, left scrotum, approximately 8 cm. Laboratory data included a hematocrit of 43.5, hemoglobin of 15.0, and white count 4700. Creatinine 1.3, sodium 141, and potassium 4.0. Calcium 8.6. Chest x-ray was unremarkable. EKG was normal.PROCEDURE: The patient was satisfactorily given general anesthesia, prepped and draped in supine position, and left scrotal incision was made, carried down to the tunica vaginalis forming the hydrocele. This was dissected free from the scrotal wall back to the base of the testicle and then excised back to the spermatic cord. In the fashion, the hydrocele was excised and fluid drained.Cord was infiltrated with 5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine. The edges of the tunica vaginalis adjacent to the spermatic cord were oversewn with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures for hemostasis. The left testicle was replaced into the left scrotal compartment and affixed to the overlying Dartos fascia with a 3-0 Vicryl suture through the edge of the tunica vaginalis and the overlying Dartos fascia.The left scrotal incision was closed, first closing the Dartos fascia with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. Skin was closed with an interrupted running 4-0 chromic suture. A sterile dressing was applied. The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, upon awakening from general anesthesia. Plan is to discharge the patient and see him back in the office in a week or 2 in followup. Further plans will depend upon how he does."
65,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Coronal hypospadias with chordee.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Coronal hypospadias with chordee.PROCEDURE: Hypospadias repair (urethroplasty plate incision with tissue flap relocation and chordee release).ANESTHESIA: General inhalation anesthetic with a 0.25% Marcaine dorsal block and ring block per surgeon, 7 mL given.TUBES AND DRAINS: An 8-French Zaontz catheter.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 10 mL.FLUIDS RECEIVED: 300 mL.INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 6-month-old boy with the history of coronal hypospadias with chordee. Plan is for repair.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room with surgical consent, operative site, and the patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, IV antibiotics were given. The dorsal hood was retracted and cleansed. He was then sterilely prepped and draped. Stay suture of #4-0 Prolene was then placed in the glans. His urethra was calibrated to 10-French bougie-a-boule. We then marked the coronal cuff and the penile shaft skin, as well as the periurethral meatal area on the ventrum. Byers flaps were also marked. Once this was done, the skin was then incised around the coronal cuff with 15-blade knife and further extended with the curved tenotomy scissors to deglove the penis. On the ventrum, the chordee tissue was removed and dissected up towards the urethral plate to use as secondary tissue flap coverage. Once this was done, an electrocautery was used for hemostasis were then used. A vessel loop tourniquet and IV grade saline was used for achieve artificial erection and chordee. We then incised Buck fascia at the area of chordee in the ventrum and then used the #5-0 Prolene as a Heinecke-Mikulicz advancement suture. Sutures were placed burying the knot and then artificial erection was again performed showing the penis was straight. We then left the tourniquet in place, although loosened it slightly and then marked out the transurethral incision plate with demarcation for the glans and the ventral midline of the plate. We then incised it with the ophthalmic micro lancet blade in the midline and along the __________ to elevate the glanular wings. Using the curved iris scissors, we then elevated the wings even further. Again, electrocautery was used for hemostasis. An 8-French Zaontz catheter was then placed into the urethral plate and then interrupted suture of #7-0 Vicryl was used to mark the distal most extent of the urethral meatus and then the urethral plate was rolled using a subcutaneous closure using the #7-0 Vicryl suture. There were two areas of coverage with the tissue flap relocation from the glanular wings. The tissue flap that was rolled with the Byers flap was used to cover this, as well as the chordee tissue with interrupted sutures of #7-0 Vicryl. Once this was completed, the glans itself had been rolled using two deep sutures of #5-0 Vicryl. Interrupted sutures of #7-0 Vicryl were used to create the neomeatus and then horizontal mattress sutures of #7-0 Vicryl used to roll the glans in the midline. The extra dorsal hood tissue of preputial skin was then excised. An interrupted sutures of #6-0 chromic were then used to approximate penile shaft skin to the coronal cuff and on the ventrum around the midline. The patient's scrotum was slightly asymmetric; however, this was due to the tissue configuration of the scrotum itself. At the end of the procedure, stay suture of #4-0 Prolene was used to tack the drain into place and a Dermabond and Surgicel were used for dressing. Telfa and the surgical eye tape was then used for the final dressing. IV Toradol was given. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room."
66,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Penoscrotal hypospadias with chordee.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Penoscrotal hypospadias with chordee.PROCEDURE: Hypospadias repair (TIT and tissue flap relocation) and Nesbit tuck chordee release.ANESTHESIA: General inhalation anesthetic with a caudal block.FLUIDS RECEIVED: 300 mL of crystalloids.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 15 mL.SPECIMENS: No tissue sent to Pathology.TUBES AND DRAINS: An 8-French Zaontz catheter.INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 1-1/2-year-old boy with penoscrotal hypospadias; plan is for repair.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site and the patient's identification was verified. Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed. IV antibiotic was given. The dorsal hood was retracted and the patient was then sterilely prepped and draped. A stay stitch of 4-0 Prolene was then placed in the glans for traction. His urethra was calibrated, it was quite thin, to a 10-French with the straight sounds. We then marked the coronal cuff and the urethral plate as well as the penile shaft skin with marking pen and incised the coronal cuff circumferentially and then around the urethral plate with the 15 blade knife and then degloved the penis with a curved tenotomy scissors. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis. The ventral chordee tissue was removed. We then placed a vessel loop tourniquet around the base of the penis and using IV grade saline did an artificial erection test, which showed that he had a persistent chordee. In the midline a 15 blade knife was used to incise Buck fascia after marking the area of chordee with the marking pen. We then used a Heinecke-Mikulicz Nesbit tuck with 5-0 Prolene to straighten the penis. Artificial erection again performed showed the penis was straight. The knot was buried with figure-of-eight suture of 7-0 Vicryl in Buck fascia above it. We then left the tourniquet in place and then after marking the urethral plate incised it and enlarged it with Beaver blade and a 15 blade. We then elevated the glanular wings as well in the similar fashion. An 8-French Zaontz catheter was then placed and the urethral plate was then closed over this with a distal interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl and then a running subcuticular closure of 7-0 Vicryl to close the defect. We then put the stay sutures in the inter-preputial skin with 7-0 Vicryl and then rotated a flap using the subcutaneous tissue after dissecting it down to the pubis at the base of the penile shaft on the dorsum using the curved iris scissors. We buttonholed the flap and then placed it through the penis as a sleeve. Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl then used to reapproximate and to tack this flap and place over the urethroplasty. Once this was done, a two 5-0 Vicryl deep sutures were placed in the glans to rotate the glans and allow for hemostasis. Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were then used to create the neomeatus and horizontal mattress sutures of 7-0 Vicryl used to reconstitute the glans. We then removed the excessive preputial skin and using tacking sutures of 6-0 chromic tacked the penile shaft skin to the coronal cuff and on the ventrum we dropped a portion of the skin down on the left side of the penis to reconstitute the penoscrotal junction using horizontal mattress sutures. We then closed the ventral defect. Once this was done, the stay suture in the glans was used to keep the Zaontz catheter to tack it into place. We then used Surgicel, Dermabond, and Telfa dressing with Mastisol and an eye tape to keep the dressing in place. IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure. The patient was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room."

The plan is for repair.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed. IV antibiotics were given. He was then placed in the supine position. The foreskin was retracted and cleansed. He was then sterilely prepped and draped. A stay stitch of 4-0 Prolene was then placed on the glans. The urethra was calibrated with the lacrimal duct probes to an 8-French. We then marked out the coronal cuff, the penile shaft skin as well as the glanular plate for future surgery with a marking pen.We then used a 15-blade knife to circumscribe the penis around the coronal cuff. We then degloved the penis using the curved tenotomy scissors, and electrocautery was used for hemostasis. The patient had some splaying of the spongiosum tissue, which was also incised laterally and rotated to make a secondary flap. Once the penis was degloved, and the excessive chordee tissue was released, we then placed a vessel loop tourniquet around the base of the penis and using IV grade saline injected the penis for an artifical erection. He was still noted to have chordee, so a midline incision through the Buck fascia was made with a 15-blade knife and Heineke-Mikulicz closure using 5-0 Prolene was then used for the chordee Nesbit tuck. We repeated the artificial erection and the penis was straight. We then incised the urethral plate with an ophthalmic blade in the midline, and then elevated the glanular wings using a 15-blade knife to elevate and then incise them. Using the curved iris scissors, we then also further mobilized the glanular wings. The 8-French Zaontz was then placed while the tourniquet was still in place into the urethral plate. The upper aspect of the distal meatus was then closed with an interrupted suture of 7-0 Vicryl, and then using a running subcuticular closure, we closed the urethral plates over the Zaontz catheter. We then mobilized subcutaneous tissue from the penile shaft skin, and the inner perpetual skin on the dorsum, and then buttonholed the flap, placed it over the head of the penis, and then, used it to cover of the hypospadias repair with tacking sutures of 7-0 Vicryl. We then rolled the spongiosum flap to cover the distal urethra that was also somewhat dysplastic; 7-0 Vicryl was used for that as well. 5-0 Vicryl was used to roll the glans with 2 deep sutures, and then, horizontal mattress sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were used to reconstitute the glans. Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were used to approximate the urethral meatus to the glans. Once this was done, we then excised the excessive penile shaft skin, and used the interrupted sutures of 6-0 chromic to attach the penile shaft skin to the coronal cuff. On the ventrum itself, we used horizontal mattress sutures to close the defect.At the end of the procedure, the Zaontz catheter was sutured into place with a 4-0 Prolene suture, Dermabond tissue adhesive, and Surgicel was used as a dressing and a second layer of Telfa and clear eye tape was then used to tape it into place. IV Toradol was given at the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was in a stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room."

Total abdominal hysterectomy.2. Bilateral salpingooophorectomy.3. Repair of bladder laceration.4. Appendectomy.5. Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz cystourethropexy.6. Posterior colpoperineoplasty.GROSS FINDINGS: The patient had a history of a rapidly growing mass on the abdomen, extending from the pelvis over the past two to three months. She had a recent D&C and laparoscopy, and enlarged mass was noted and could not be determined if it was from the ovary or the uterus. Curettings were negative for malignancy. The patient did have a large cystocele and rectocele, and a collapsed anterior and posterior vaginal wall.Upon laparotomy, there was a giant uterine tumor extending from the pelvis up to the above the umbilicus compatible with approximately four to five-month pregnancy. The ovaries appeared to be within normal limits. There was marked adherence between the bladder and the giant uterus and mass with edema and inflammation, and during dissection, a laceration inadvertently occurred and it was immediately recognized. No other pathology noted from the abdominal cavity or adhesions. The upper right quadrant of the abdomen compatible with a previous gallbladder surgery. The appendix is in its normal anatomic position. The ileum was within normal limits with no Meckel's diverticulum seen and no other gross pathology evident. There was no evidence of metastasis or tumors in the left lobe of the liver.Upon frozen section, diagnosis of initial and partial is that of a degenerating uterine fibroid rather than a malignancy.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the Operating Room, prepped and draped in the low lithotomy position under general anesthesia. A midline incision was made around the umbilicus down to the lower abdomen. With a #10 Bard Parker blade knife, the incision was carried down through the fascia. The fascia was incised in the midline, muscle fibers were splint in the midline, the peritoneum was grasped with hemostats and with a #10 Bard Parker blade after incision was made with Mayo scissors. A Balfour retractor was placed into the wound. This giant uterus was soft and compatible with a possible leiomyosarcoma or degenerating fibroid was handled with care. The infundibular ligament on the right side was isolated and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture brought to an avascular area, doubly clamped and divided from the ovary and the ligament again re-ligated with #0 Vicryl suture. The right round ligament was ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, brought to an avascular space within the broad ligament and divided from the uterus. The infundibulopelvic ligament on the left side was treated in a similar fashion as well as the round ligament. An attempt was made to dissect the bladder flap from the anterior surface of the uterus and this was remarkably edematous and difficult to do, and during dissection the bladder was inadvertently entered. After this was immediately recognized, the bladder flap was wiped away from the anterior surface of the uterus. The bladder was then repaired with a running locking stitch #0 Vicryl suture incorporating serosal muscularis mucosa and then the second layer of overlapping seromuscular sutures were used to make a two-layer closure of #0 Vicryl suture. After removing the uterus, the bladder was tested with approximately 400 cc of sterile water and there appeared to be no leak. Progressing and removing of the uterus was then carried out and the broad ligament was clamped bilaterally with a straight Ochsner forceps and divided from the uterus with Mayo scissors, and the straight Ochsner was placed by #0 Vicryl suture thus controlling the uterine blood supply. The cardinal ligaments containing the cervical blood supply was serially clamped bilaterally with a curved Ochsner forceps, divided from the uterus with #10 Bard Parker blade knife and a curved Ochsner was placed by #0 Vicryl suture. The cervix was again grasped with a Lahey tenaculum and pubovesicocervical ligament was entered and was divided using #10 Bard Parker blade knife and then the vaginal vault and with a double pointed sharp scissors. A single-toothed tenaculum was placed on the cervix and then the uterus was removed from the vagina using hysterectomy scissors. The vaginal cuff was then closed using a running #0 Vicryl suture in locking stitch incorporating all layers of the vagina, the cardinal ligaments of the lateral aspect and uterosacral ligaments on the posterior aspect. The round ligaments were approximated to the vaginal cuff with #0 Vicryl suture and the bladder flap approximated to the round ligaments with #000 Vicryl suture. The ______ was re-peritonealized with #000 Vicryl suture and then the cecum brought into the incision. The pelvis was irrigated with approximately 500 cc of water. The appendix was grasped with Babcock forceps. The mesoappendix was doubly clamped with curved hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors. The curved hemostats were placed with #00 Vicryl suture. The base of the appendix was ligated with #0 plain gut suture, doubly clamped and divided from the distal appendix with #10 Bard Parker blade knife, and the base inverted with a pursestring suture with #00 Vicryl. No bleeding was noted. Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were found to be correct. All packs and retractors were removed. The peritoneum muscle fascia was closed in single-layer closure using running looped #1 PDS, but prior to closure, a Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz cystourethropexy was carried out by dissecting the space of Retzius identifying the urethra in the vesical junction approximating the periurethral connective tissue to the symphysis pubis with interrupted #0 Vicryl suture. Following this, the abdominal wall was closed as previously described and the skin was closed using skin staples. Attention was then turned to the vagina, where the introitus of the vagina was grasped with an Allis forceps at the level of the Bartholin glands. An incision was made between the mucous and the cutaneous junction and then a midline incision was made at the posterior vaginal mucosa in a tunneling fashion with Metzenbaum scissors. The flaps were created bilaterally by making an incision in the posterior connective tissue of the vagina and wiping the rectum away from the posterior vaginal mucosa, and flaps were created bilaterally. In this fashion, the rectocele was reduced and the levator ani muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #0 Vicryl suture. Excess vaginal mucosa was excised and the vaginal mucosa closed with running #00 Vicryl suture. The bulbocavernosus and transverse perinei muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #00 Vicryl suture. The skin was closed with a running #000 plain gut subcuticular stitch. The vaginal vault was packed with a Betadine-soaked Kling gauze sponge. Sterile dressing was applied. The patient was sent to recovery room in stable condition."
69,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Penoscrotal abscess.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Penoscrotal abscess.OPERATION: Incision and drainage of the penoscrotal abscess, packing, penile biopsy, cystoscopy, and urethral dilation.BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 75-year-old male presented with penoscrotal abscess. Options such as watchful waiting, drainage, and antibiotics were discussed. Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, completely the infection turning into necrotizing fascitis, Fournier's gangrene were discussed. The patient already had significant phimotic changes and disfigurement of the penis. For further debridement the patient was told that his penis is not going to be viable, he may need a total or partial penectomy now or in the future. Risks of decreased penile sensation, pain, Foley, other unexpected issues were discussed. The patient understood all the complications and wanted to proceed with the procedure.DETAIL OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the OR. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Pictures were taken prior to starting the procedure for documentation. The patient had an open sore on the right side of the penis measuring about 1 cm in size with pouring pus out using blunt dissection. The penile area was opened up distally to allow the pus to come out. The dissection around the proximal scrotum was done to make sure there are no other pus pockets. The corporal body was intact, but the distal part of the corpora was completely eroded and had a fungating mass, which was biopsied and sent for permanent pathology analysis.Urethra was identified at the distal tip, which was dilated and using 23-French cystoscope cystoscopy was done, which showed some urethral narrowing in the distal part of the urethra. The rest of the bladder appeared normal. The prostatic urethra was slightly enlarged. There are no stones or tumors inside the bladder. There were moderate trabeculations inside the bladder. Otherwise, the bladder and the urethra appeared normal. There was a significantly fungating mass involving the distal part of the urethra almost possibility to have including the fungating wart or fungating squamous cell carcinoma. Again biopsies were sent for pathology analysis. Prior to urine irrigation anaerobic aerobic cultures were sent, irrigation with over 2 L of fluid was performed. After irrigation, packing was done with Kerlix. The patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition. Please note that 18-French Foley was kept in place. Electrocautery was used at the end of the procedure to obtain hemostasis as much as possible, but there was fungating mass with slight bleeding packing was done and tight scrotal Kling was applied. The patient was brought to Recovery in a stable condition after applying 0.5% Marcaine about 20 mL were injected around for local anesthesia."
70,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bilateral inguinal hernias with bilateral hydroceles after right inguinal hernia repair, cerebral palsy, asthma, seizure disorder, developmental delay, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Left inguinal hernia, bilateral hydroceles, and right torsed appendix testis.PROCEDURE: Right inguinal exploration, left inguinal hernia repair, bilateral hydrocele repair, and excision of right appendix testis.FLUIDS RECEIVED: 700 mL of crystalloid.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 10 mL.SPECIMENS: Tissue sent to pathology is calcified right appendix testis.TUBES/DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used.COUNTS: Sponge and needle counts were correct x2.ANESTHESIA: General inhalational anesthetic and 0.25% Marcaine ilioinguinal nerve block, 30 mL given per surgeon.INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 14-1/2-year-old boy with multiple medical problems, primarily due to cerebral palsy, asthma, seizures, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and developmental delay. He had a hernia repair done on the right in the past, but developed a new hernia on the right and a smaller on the left. The plan is for repair.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in the supine position. IV antibiotics were given. He was then sterilely prepped and draped. A right inguinal incision was made in the previous incisional site with a 15-blade knife, extended down through the subcutaneous tissue and Scarpa fascia with electrocautery. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.The external oblique fascia was then visualized and incised. There was a moderate amount of scar tissue noted, but we were able to incise that and go down into the right inguinal canal. Upon dissection there, we did not find any hernias; however, he did have a fairly sizable hydrocele. We went down towards the external ring and found that this was indeed tight without any hernias.We then closed up the external oblique fascia and made an incision after doing a shave on the right and left scrotum into the upper scrotal sac with a curvilinear incision with a 15-blade knife. We then extended down to the subcutaneous tissue. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis. The hydrocele sac was visualized and then drained after incising into it with a curved Metzenbaum scissors. The testis was then delivered and found to have a moderate amount of scar tissue with a calcified appendix testis, which was then excised and sent to pathology. We then checked the upper aspect of the tunica vaginalis pouch and found that there was indeed no other connection, was up above, so we then wrapped the sac around the back of the testis, and closed it with a 4-0 chromic suture in a Lord maneuver. We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic and placed the testis into the scrotum in the proper orientation. We then used an ilioinguinal nerve block and wound instillation on both incisional areas with 0.25% Marcaine without epinephrine; 15 mL was given.We performed a similar procedure on the left, incising it at the scrotal area first, rather than below, and found this tunica vaginalis, and dissected it in a similar fashion and cauterized the appendix testis, which was not torsed. This was a smaller hydrocele, but because of the __________ shunt, we went up above and found that there was a very small connection, which was then dissected off the cord structures gently, twisted upon itself, suture ligated with a 2-0 Vicryl suture.The ilioinguinal nerve block and other wound instillations again with 15 mL total of 0.25% Marcaine were then done by the surgeon as well. The external oblique fascia was closed on both sides with a running suture of 2-0 Vicryl. 4-0 chromic was then used to close the Scarpa fascia. The skin was closed with a 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure. The scrotal incisions were closed with a subcutaneous and dartos closure using 4-0 chromic. IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure. Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on all 4 incisions. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was in a stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room."
71,Urology,"(Medical Transcription Sample Report)PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left communicating hydrocele.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left communicating hydrocele.ANESTHESIA: General.PROCEDURE: Left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair.INDICATIONS: The patient is a 5-year-old young man with fluid collection in the tunica vaginalis and peritesticular space on the left side consistent with a communicating hydrocele. The fluid size tends to fluctuate with time but has been relatively persistent for the past year. I met with the patient's mom and also spoke with his father by phone in the past couple of months and explained the diagnosis of patent processus vaginalis for communicating hydrocele and talked to them about the surgical treatment and options. All their questions have been answered and the patient is fit for operation today.OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient had a very thin patent processus vaginalis leading to a rather sizeable hydrocele sac in the left hemiscrotum. We probably drained around 10 to 15 mL of fluid from the hydrocele sac. The processus vaginalis was clearly seen back to the peritoneal reflection where a high ligation was successfully performed. There were no other abnormalities noted in the inguinal scrotal region.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of inhalation anesthetic. A peripheral IV was placed, and we conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of The patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were indeed going to perform a left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair. After preparation and draping was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution, a local infiltration block as well as an ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block was performed with 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine. A curvilinear incision was made low in the left inguinal area along one of prominent skin folds. Soft tissue dissection was carried down through Scarpa's layer to the external oblique fascia, which was then opened to expose the underlying spermatic cord structures. The processus vaginalis was dissected free from the spermatic cord structures, and the distal hydrocele sac was widely opened and drained of its fluid contents. The processus vaginalis was cleared back to peritoneal reflection at the deep inguinal ring and a high ligation was performed there using both the transfixing and a mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl. After the excess hydrocele and processus vaginalis tissue was excised, the spermatic cord structures were replaced and the external oblique and Scarpa's layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for the final skin closure. The patient tolerated the operation well. He was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition. Blood loss was minimal. No specimen was submitted."
72,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bilateral inguinal hernia, bilateral hydroceles.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bilateral inguinal hernia, bilateral hydroceles.PROCEDURES: Bilateral inguinal hernia and bilateral hydrocele repair with an ilioinguinal nerve block bilaterally by surgeon 20 mL given.ANESTHESIA: General inhalational anesthetic.ABNORMAL FINDINGS: Same as above.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL.FLUIDS RECEIVED: 400 mL of Crystalloid.DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used.COUNT: Sponge and needle counts were correct x2.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 7-year-old boy with the history of fairly sizeable right inguinal hernia and hydrocele, was found to have a second smaller one on evaluation with ultrasound and physical exam. Plan is for repair of both.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site and the patient's identification was verified. Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position and sterilely prepped and draped. A right inguinal incision was then made with 15 blade knife and further extended with electrocautery down to the subcutaneous tissue and electrocautery was also used for hemostasis. The external oblique fascia was then visualized and incised with 15 blade knife and further extended with curved tenotomy scissors. Using a curved mosquito clamp, we gently dissected into the inguinal canal until we got the hernia sac and dissected it out of the canal. The cord structures were then dissected off the sac and then the sac itself was divided in the midline, twisted upon itself and suture ligated up at the peritoneal reflection with 3-0 Vicryl suture. This was done twice. The distal end where a large hydrocele noted, was gently milked into the lower aspect of the incision. The hydrocele sac was then opened and drained and then the testis was delivered into the field. The sac was then opened completely around the testis. The appendix testis was cauterized. We wrapped the sac around the back of the testis and tacked into place using the Lord maneuver using 4-0 Vicryl as a figure-of-eight suture. Once this was done, the testis was then placed back into the scrotum in the proper orientation. Ilioinguinal nerve block and wound instillation was then done with 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine. A similar procedure was done on the left side, also finding a small hernia, which was divided and ligated with the 3-0 Vicryl as on the right side and distally the hydrocele sac was also wrapped around the back of the testis in a Lord maneuver after opening the sac completely. Again both testes were placed into the scrotum after the hydroceles were treated and then the external oblique fascia was closed on both sides with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and the cord structures not involved in the closure. Scarpa fascia was closed with 4-0 chromic suture on each side and the skin was closed with 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure. Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on both incisions. IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure and both testes were well descended within the scrotum at the end of the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure and was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room."

The patient is being taken to the operating room for inguinal hernia repair.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general endotracheal anesthesia. The patient's inguinal and scrotal area were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. An incision was made in the right inguinal skin crease. The incision was taken down to the level of the aponeurosis of the external oblique, which was incised up to the level of the external ring. The hernia sac was verified and dissected at the level of the internal ring and a high ligation performed. The distal remnant was taken to its end and excised. The testicle and cord structures were placed back in their native positions. The aponeurosis of the external oblique was reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl as well as the Scarpa's, the skin closed with 5-0 Monocryl and dressed with Steri-Strips. The patient was extubated in the operating room and taken back to the recovery room. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
74,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left inguinal hernia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left direct and indirect inguinal hernia.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Repair of left inguinal hernia with Prolene mesh.ANESTHESIA: IV sedation with local.COMPLICATIONS: None.DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Recovery in stable condition.SPECIMEN: Hernia sac, as well as turbid fluid with gram stain, which came back with no organisms from the hernia sac.BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 53-year-old male who presented to Dr. Y's office with a bulge in the left groin and was found to have a left inguinal hernia increasing over the past several months. The patient has a history of multiple abdominal surgeries and opted for an open left inguinal hernial repair with Prolene mesh.INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient was found to have a direct as well as an indirect component to the left inguinal hernia with a large sac. The patient was also found to have some turbid fluid within the hernia sac, which was sent down for gram stain and turned out to be negative with no organisms.PROCEDURE: After informed consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient, the patient was brought to the operative suite, prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion. The left inguinal ligament was identified from the pubic tubercle to the ASIS. Two fingerbreadths above the pubic tubercle, a transverse incision was made. First, the skin was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine and then an incision was made with a #15 blade scalpel, approximately 6 cm in length. Dissection was then carried down with electro Bovie cautery through Scarpa's fascia maintaining hemostasis. Once the external oblique was identified, external oblique was incised in the length of its fibers with a #15 blade scalpel. Metzenbaum scissors were then used to extend the incision in both directions opening up the external oblique down to the external ring. Next, the external oblique was grasped with Ochsner on both sides. The cord, cord structures as well as hernia sac were freed up circumferentially and a Penrose drain was placed around it. Next, the hernia sac was identified and the anteromedial portion of the hernia sac was stripped down, grasped with two hemostats. A Metzenbaum scissor was then used to open the hernia sac and the hernia sac was explored. There was some turbid fluid within the hernia sac, which was sent down for cultures. Gram stain was negative for organisms. Next, the hernia sac was to be ligated at its base and transected. A peon was used at the base. Metzenbaum scissor was used to cut the hernia sac and sending it off as a specimen. An #0 Vicryl stick suture was used with #0 Vicryl loop suture to suture ligate the hernia sac at its base.Next, attention was made to placing a Prolene mesh to cover the floor. The mesh was sutured to the pubic tubercle medially along the ilioinguinal ligament inferiorly and along the conjoint tendon superiorly making a slit for the cord and cord structures. Attention was made to salvaging the ilioinguinal nerve, which was left above the repair of the mesh and below the external oblique once closed and appeared to be intact. Attention was next made after suturing the mesh with the #2-0 Polydek suture. The external oblique was then closed over the roof with a running #0 Vicryl suture, taking care not to strangulate the cord and to recreate the external ring. After injecting the external oblique and cord structures with Marcaine for anesthetic, the Scarpa's fascia was approximated with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl suture. Steri-Strip with sterile dressings were applied.The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Recovery in stable condition."
75,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE: Bilateral direct inguinal hernia repair utilizing PHS system and placement of On-Q pain pump. ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation and the abdomen and groins were prepped and draped in standard, sterile surgical fashion. I did an ilioinguinal nerve block on both sides, injecting Marcaine 1 fingerbreadth anterior and 1 fingerbreadth superior to the anterior superior iliac spine on both sides. I began on the right side by making an incision in a skin crease 1 fingerbreadth above the pubic tubercle. I dissected down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through Scarpa's fascia. I identified the external ring and divided the external oblique up toward the anterior superior iliac spine. I located the ilioinguinal nerve and isolated it out of the wound. I encircled the cord structures and, dissecting out the cord structures, I did not visualize any sac. The floor of the inguinal canal was very loose and there was an obvious direct hernia. I cut open the floor and dissected out the preperitoneal space so I created a preperitoneal space. I took a PHS mesh system and took the posterior portion of the PHS mesh system and put it in through the hole in the floor of the inguinal canal. I made sure that it sat flat completely covering the myopectineal orifice. I then tacked the anterior part of the PHS mesh system to the pubic tubercle, superiorly to the internal oblique, inferiorly to the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament. I cut a hole in the mesh and recreated the internal ring and sewed it closed, making sure it was not too tight on the cord structures. I tucked the extended portion of the mesh underneath the external oblique between the external oblique and the internal oblique, thereby completing the hernia repair. I placed the ilioinguinal nerve back in its anatomical position. I then closed the external obliques with a running 3-0 Vicryl. I placed on On-Q pain pump through a separate stab incision utilizing a tear-away sheath catheter. I then closed Scarpa's fascia, the subcutaneous tissue and skin with a running Monocryl. I did the exact same procedure on the opposite side. On the left side, I cut a skin incision in the skin crease above the pubic tubercle. I dissected down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. I opened up Scarpa's fascia and identified the external ring. I opened up the external ring towards the anterior superior iliac spine. I isolated the ilioinguinal nerve so it was not damaged. I dissected out the cord and inspected the cord carefully. I did not see any sac there, but there was a weak direct floor with an obvious direct inguinal hernia. I opened the floor over this direct inguinal hernia. I cleared out the preperitoneal space and then placed the posterior portion of the PHS mesh system in place and made it lay out flat in order to cover the myopectineal orifice. I took the anterior portion of the mesh and tacked it to the pubic tubercle. I tacked the superior portion to the internal oblique, inferior portion to the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament. I cut a hole in order to incorporate the cord structures and sewed it back together. I made sure this was not too tight. I then tucked the extended portion of the mesh underneath the external oblique between the external oblique and the internal oblique. I returned the ilioinguinal nerve to its original position. I closed the external oblique with a running 3-0 Vicryl. I placed an On-Q pain pump through a separate stab incision and had the catheter thread right into the wound cavity. I then closed the Scarpa's fascia with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture. I closed the subcutaneous tissue with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture and closed the skin with running Monocryl. Sponge, instrument and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications."
76,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right direct inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE: Right direct inguinal hernia repair with PHS mesh system. ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation. The Right groin and abdomen were prepped and draped in the standard sterile surgical fashion. An incision was made approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the pubic tubercle and in a skin crease. Dissection was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Scarpa's fascia was divided, and the external ring was located. The external oblique was divided from the external ring up towards the anterior superior iliac spine. The cord structures were then encircled. Careful inspection of the cord structures did not reveal any indirect sac along the cord structures. I did, however, feel a direct sac with a direct defect. I opened the floor of the inguinal canal and dissected out the preperitoneal space at the direct sac and cut out the direct sac. Once I cleared out the preperitoneal space, I placed a PHS mesh system with a posterior mesh into the preperitoneal space, and I made sure that it laid flat along Cooper's ligament and covered the myopectineal orifice. I then tucked the extended portion of the anterior mesh underneath the external oblique between the external oblique and the internal oblique, and I then tacked the medial portion of the mesh to the pubic tubercle with a 0 Ethibond suture. I tacked the superior portion of the mesh to the internal oblique and the inferior portion of the mesh to the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament. I cut a hole in the mesh in order to incorporate the cord structures and recreated the internal ring, making sure that it was not too tight so that it did not strangulate the cord structures. I then closed the external oblique with a running 3-0 Vicryl. I closed the Scarpa's with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and I closed the skin with a running Monocril. Sponge, instrument and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well and without any complications."
77,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right inguinal hernia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Direct right inguinal hernia.TITLE OF PROCEDURE: Marlex repair of right inguinal hernia.ANESTHESIA: Spinal.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operative suite, placed on the table in the supine position, and given a spinal anesthetic. The right inguinal region was shaved and prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. The patient received 1 gm of Ancef IV push.Transverse incision was made in the intraabdominal crease and carried through skin and subcutaneous tissue. The external oblique fascia was exposed and incised down to and through the external inguinal ring. The spermatic cord and hernia sac were dissected bluntly off the undersurface of the external oblique fascia exposing the attenuated floor of the inguinal canal. The cord was surrounded with a Penrose drain. The hernia sac was separated from the cord structures. The floor of the inguinal canal, which consisted of attenuated transversalis fascia, was imbricated upon itself with a running locked suture of 2-0 Prolene. Marlex patch 1 x 4 in dimension was trimmed to an appropriate shape with a defect to accommodate the cord. It was placed around the cord and sutured to itself with 2-0 Prolene. The patch was then sutured medially to the pubic tubercle, inferiorly to Cooper's ligament and inguinal ligaments, and superiorly to conjoined tendon using 2-0 Prolene. The area was irrigated with saline solution, and 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine was injected to provide prolonged postoperative pain relief. The cord was returned to its position. External oblique fascia was closed with a running 2-0 PDS, subcu with 2-0 Vicryl, and skin with running subdermal 4-0 Vicryl and Steri-Strips. Sponge and needle counts were correct. Sterile dressing was applied."
78,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right inguinal hernia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right inguinal hernia.ANESTHESIA: General.PROCEDURE: Right inguinal hernia repair.INDICATIONS: The patient is a 4-year-old boy with a right inguinal bulge, which comes and goes with Valsalva standing and some increased physical activity. He had an inguinal hernia on physical exam in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic and is here now for elective repair. We met with his parents and explained the surgical technique, risks, and talked to them about trying to perform a diagnostic laparoscopic look at the contralateral side to rule out an occult hernia. All their questions have been answered and they agreed with the plan.OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient had a well developed, but rather thin walled hernia sac on the right. The thinness of hernia sac made it difficult to safely cannulate through the sac for the laparoscopy. Therefore, high ligation was performed, and we aborted the plan for laparoscopic view of the left side.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient came to operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia. Surgical time-out was conducted while we were preparing and draping his abdomen with chlorhexidine based prep solution. During our time-out, we reiterated the patient's name, medical record number, weight, allergies status, and planned operative procedure. I then infiltrated 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine in the soft tissues around the inguinal crease in the right lower abdomen chosen for hernia incision. An additional aliquot of Marcaine was injected deep to the external oblique fascia performing the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block. A curvilinear incision was made with a scalpel and a combination of electrocautery and some blunt dissection and scissor dissection was used to clear the tissue layers through Scarpa fascia and expose the external oblique. After the oblique layers were opened, the cord structure were identified and elevated. The hernia sac was carefully separated from the spermatic cord structures and control of the sac was obtained. Dissection of the hernia sac back to the peritoneal reflection at the level of deep inguinal ring was performed. I attempted to gently pass a 3-mm trocar through the hernia sac, but it was rather difficult and I became fearful that the sac would be torn in proximal control and mass ligation would be less effective. I aborted the laparoscopic approach and performed a high ligation using transfixing and a simple mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl. The excess sac was trimmed and the spermatic cord structures were replaced. The external oblique fascia and Scarpa layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips. The patient tolerated the operation well. Blood loss was less than 5 mL. The hernia sac was submitted for specimen, and he was then taken to the recovery room in good condition."
79,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left inguinal hernia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left indirect inguinal hernia.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Repair of left inguinal hernia indirect.ANESTHESIA: Spinal with local.COMPLICATIONS: None.DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well, was transferred to recovery in stable condition.SPECIMEN: Hernia sac.BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 60-year-old female that presented to Dr. X's office with complaints of a bulge in the left groin. The patient states that she noticed there this bulge and pain for approximately six days prior to arrival. Upon examination in the office, the patient was found to have a left inguinal hernia consistent with tear, which was scheduled as an outpatient surgery.INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient was found to have a left indirect inguinal hernia.PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient. The patient was brought to the operating suite. After spinal anesthesia and sedation given, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion. In the area of the left inguinal region just superior to the left inguinal ligament tract, the skin was anesthetized with 0.25% Marcaine. Next, a skin incision was made with a #10 blade scalpel. Using Bovie electrocautery, dissection was carried down to Scarpa's fascia until the external oblique was noted. Along the side of the external oblique in the direction of the external ring, incision was made on both sides of the external oblique and then grasped with a hemostat. Next, the hernia and hernia sac was circumferentially grasped and elevated along with the round ligament. Attention was next made to ligating the hernia sac at its base for removal. The hernia sac was opened prior grasping with hemostats. It was a sliding indirect hernia. The bowel contents were returned to abdomen using a #0 Vicryl stick tie pursestring suture at its base. The hernia sac was ligated and then cut above with the Metzenbaum scissors returning it to the abdomen. This was then sutured at the apex of the repair down to the conjoint tendon. Next, attention was made to completely removing the round ligament hernia sac which was again ligated at its base with an #0 Vicryl suture and removed as specimen. Attention was next made to reapproximate it at floor with a modified ______ repair. Using a #2-0 Ethibond suture in simple interrupted fashion, the conjoint tendon was approximated to the ilioinguinal ligament capturing a little bit of the floor of the transversalis fascia. Once this was done, the external oblique was closed over, reapproximated again with a #2-0 Ethibond suture catching each hump in between each repair from the prior floor repair. This was done in simple interrupted fashion as well. Next Scarpa's fascia was reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl suture. The skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl suture. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure very well and he was transferred to Recovery in stable condition. The patient had an abnormal chest x-ray in preop and is going for a CT of the chest in Recovery."
80,Urology,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Inguinal herniorrhaphy.PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.A standard inguinal incision was made and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery. The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated. The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel, and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors. Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was placed around the cord structures at the level of the pubic tubercle. This Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed. Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery.The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and the sac was found anteromedially to the cord structures. The sac was dissected free from the cord structures using a combination of blunt dissection and Bovie electrocautery. Once preperitoneal fat was encountered, the dissection stopped and the sac was suture ligated at the level of the preperitoneal fat using a 2-0 silk suture ligature. The sac was excised and went to Pathology. The ends of the suture were then cut and the stump retracted back into the abdomen.The Penrose drain was removed. The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery. The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring. The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped and draped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. A dressing consisting of a 2 x 2 and OpSite was then applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct.Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
81,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Inguinal hernia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Direct inguinal hernia.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rutkow direct inguinal herniorrhaphy.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. Preoperative antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.A standard inguinal incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery. The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated. The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors. Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was placed around the cord structures at the level of the pubic tubercle. This Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed. Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery.The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and no sac was found. The hernia was found coming from the floor of the inguinal canal medial to the inferior epigastric vessels. This was dissected back to the hernia opening. The hernia was inverted back into the abdominal cavity and a large PerFix plug inserted into the ring. The plug was secured to the ring by interrupted 2-0 Prolene sutures.The PerFix onlay patch was then placed on the floor of the inguinal canal and secured in place using interrupted 2-0 Prolene sutures. By reinforcing the floor with the onlay patch, a new internal ring was thus formed.The Penrose drain was removed. The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery. The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring. The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct.Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
82,Urology,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Bassini inguinal herniorrhaphy.ANESTHESIA: Local with MAC anesthesia.PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. The patient was sedated and an adequate local anesthetic was administered using 1% lidocaine without epinephrine. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.A standard inguinal incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery. The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated. The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors. Care was taken not to injure the ilioinguinal nerve. Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed. Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery.The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and the sac was found anteromedially to the cord structures. The sac was dissected free from the cord structures using a combination of blunt dissection and Bovie electrocautery.Once preperitoneal fat was encountered, the dissection stopped and the sac was suture ligated at the level of the preperitoneal fat using a 2-0 silk suture ligature. The sac was excised and sent to Pathology. The stump was examined and no bleeding was noted. The ends of the suture were then cut, and the stump retracted back into the abdomen.The floor of the inguinal canal was then strengthened by suturing the shelving edge of Poupart's ligament to the conjoined tendon using a 2-0 Prolene, starting at the pubic tubercle and running towards the internal ring. In this manner, an internal ring was created that admitted just the tip of my smallest finger.The Penrose drain was removed. The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery. The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring. Marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior and superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control. The skin incision was approximated with skin staples. A dressing was then applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct.Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
83,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left inguinal hernia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left inguinal hernia, direct.PROCEDURE: Left inguinal herniorrhaphy, modified Bassini.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was electively taken to the operating room. In same day surgery, Dr. X applied a magnet to the pacemaker defibrillator that the patient has to change it into a fixed mode and to protect the device from the action of the cautery. Informed consent was obtained, and the patient was transferred to the operating room where a time-out process was followed and the patient under general endotracheal anesthesia was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Local anesthesia was used as a field block and then an incision was made in the left inguinal area and carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis, which was opened. The cord was isolated and protected. It was dissected out. The lipoma of the cord was removed and the sac was high ligated. The main hernia was a direct hernia due to weakness of the floor. A Bassini repair was performed. We used a number of interrupted sutures of 2-0 Tevdek __________ in the conjoint tendon and the ilioinguinal ligament.The external oblique muscle was approximated same as the soft tissue with Vicryl and then the skin was closed with subcuticular suture of Monocryl. The dressing was applied and the patient tolerated the procedure well, estimated blood loss was minimal, was transferred to recovery room in satisfactory condition."
84,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent right inguinal hernia, as well as phimosis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent right inguinal hernia, as well as phimosis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic right inguinal herniorrhaphy with mesh, as well as a circumcision.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.COMPLICATIONS: None.DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition.SPECIMEN: Foreskin.BRIEF HISTORY: This patient is a 66-year-old African-American male who presented to Dr. Y's office with recurrent right inguinal hernia for the second time requesting hernia repair. The procedure was discussed with the patient and the patient opted for laparoscopic repair due to multiple attempts at the open inguinal repair on the right. The patient also is requesting circumcision with phimosis at the same operating time setting.INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient was found to have a right inguinal hernia with omentum and bowel within the hernia, which was easily reduced. The patient was also found to have a phimosis, which was easily removed.PROCEDURE: After informed consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient. The patient was brought to operating suite, after general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion. An infraumbilical incision was made with a #15 Bard-Parker scalpel. The umbilical skin was elevated with a towel clip and the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty. Saline drop test proved entrance into the abdominal cavity and then the abdomen was insufflated to sufficient pressure of 15 mmHg. Next, the Veress was removed and #10 bladed trocar was inserted without difficulty. The 30-degree camera laparoscope was then inserted and the abdomen was explored. There was evidence of a large right inguinal hernia, which had omentum as well as bowel within it, easily reducible. Attention was next made to placing a #12 port in the right upper quadrant, four fingerbreadths from the umbilicus. Again, a skin was made with a #15 blade scalpel and the #12 port was inserted under direct visualization. A #5 port was inserted in the left upper quadrant in similar fashion without difficulty under direct visualization. Next, a grasper with blunt dissector was used to reduce the hernia and withdraw the sac and using an Endoshears, the peritoneum was scored towards the midline and towards the medial umbilical ligament and lateral. The peritoneum was then spread using the blunt dissector, opening up and identifying the iliopubic tract, which was identified without difficulty. Dissection was carried out, freeing up the hernia sac from the peritoneum. This was done without difficulty reducing the hernia in its entirety. Attention was next made to placing a piece of Prolene mesh, it was placed through the #12 port and placed into the desired position, stapled into place in its medial aspect via the 4 mm staples along the iliopubic tract. The 4.8 mm staples were then used to staple the superior edge of the mesh just below the peritoneum and then the patient was re-peritonealized, re-approximating edge of the perineum with the 4.8 mm staples. This was done without difficulty. All three ports were removed under direct visualization. No evidence of bleeding and the #10 and #12 mm ports were closed with #0-Vicryl and UR6 needle. Skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. Attention was next made to carrying out the circumcision. The foreskin was retracted back over the penis head. The desired amount of removing foreskin was marked out with a skin marker. The foreskin was then put on tension using a clamp to protect the penis head. A #15 blade scalpel was used to remove the foreskin and sending off as specimen. This was done without difficulty. Next, the remaining edges were retracted, hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery and the skin edges were re-approximated with #2-0 plain gut in simple interrupted fashion and circumferentially. This was done without difficulty maintaining hemostasis.A petroleum jelly was applied with a Coban dressing. The patient tolerated this procedure well and was well and was transferred to recovery after extubation in stable condition."
85,Urology,"The patient was placed in the supine position, prepped and draped in the usual manner. A transverse inguinal skin crease incision was made and carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis. The testicle was isolated and found coming out of the inguinal ring and separated from the spermatic cord. The hernia sac which was very filmy was elevated off of the spermatic vessels, preserving the spermatic vessels and vas without difficulty. Adequate length was able to be achieved without causing too much tension on the spermatic vessels. Using blunt and sharp dissection, a tunnel was made down into the scrotum. An incision was made in the scrotal wall and a dartos pouch was developed. A straight clamp was passed retrograde with one finger guiding the point up into the inguinal incision. A 3-0 Prolene suture was placed through the testicle and this was used to draw the testicle down through the scrotal pouch outside the scrotum. The inguinal incision was closed in layers and 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated around the incision, 3-0 chromic catgut was used to close the incision in layers without difficulty, and the skin was closed with interrupted sutures of 4-0 chromic catgut. The scrotal incision was closed with interrupted sutures of 4-0 chromic catgut and a benzoin-soaked bolster was tied to the Prolene sutures that had been placed through the scrotal wall with separate Keith needles. At the end of the procedure collodion was applied over the abdominal incision. He was sent to the recovery room in stable condition."
86,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral undescended testes.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral undescended testes, bilateral intraabdominal testes.PROCEDURE: Examination under anesthesia and laparoscopic right orchiopexy.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL.FLUIDS RECEIVED: 110 mL of crystalloid.INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: Atrophic bilateral testes, right is larger than left. The left had atrophic or dysplastic vas and epididymis.TUBES AND DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used.INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 7-1/2-month-old boy with bilateral nonpalpable testes. Plan is for exploration, possible orchiopexy.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, he was then palpated and again both testes were nonpalpable. Because of this, a laparoscopic approach was then elected. We then sterilely prepped and draped the patient, put an 8-French feeding tube in the urethra, attached to bulb grenade for drainage. We then made an infraumbilical incision with a 15-blade knife and then further extended with electrocautery and with curved mosquito clamps down to the rectus fascia where we made stay sutures of 3-0 Monocryl on the anterior and posterior sheaths and then opened up the fascia with the curved Metzenbaum scissors. Once we got into the peritoneum, we placed a 5-mm port with 0-degree short lens. Insufflation was then done with carbon dioxide up to 10 to 12 mmHg. We then evaluated. There was no bleeding noted. He had a closed ring on the left with a small testis that was evaluated and found to have short vessels as well as atrophic or dysplastic vas, which was barely visualized. The right side was also intraabdominal, but slightly larger, had better vessels, had much more recognizable vas, and it was closer to the internal ring. So, we elected to do an orchiopexy on the right side. Using the laparoscopic 3- and 5-mm dissecting scissors, we then opened up the window at the internal ring through the peritoneal tissue, then dissected it medially and laterally along the line of the vas and along the line of the vessels up towards the kidney, mid way up the abdomen, and across towards the bladder for the vas. We then used the Maryland dissector to gently tease this tissue once it was incised. The gubernaculum was then divided with electrocautery and the laparoscopic scissors. We were able to dissect with the hook dissector in addition to the scissors the peritoneal shunts with the vessels and the vas to the point where we could actually stretch and bring the testis across to the other side, left side of the ring. We then made a curvilinear incision on the upper aspect of the scrotum on the right with a 15-blade knife and extended down the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery. We used the curved tenotomy scissors to make a subdartos pouch. Using a mosquito clamp, we were able to go in through the previous internal ring opening, grasped the testis, and then pulled it through in a proper orientation. Using the hook electrode, we were able to dissect some more of the internal ring tissue to relax the vessels and the vas, so there was no much traction. Using 2 stay sutures of 4-0 chromic, we tacked the testis to the base of scrotum into the middle portion of the testis. We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a 4-0 chromic and then closed the subdartos pouch and the skin with subcutaneous 4-0 chromic. We again evaluated the left side and found again that the vessels were quite short. The testis was more atrophic, and the vas was virtually nonexistent. We will go back at a later date to try to bring this down, but it will be quite difficult and has a higher risk for atrophy because of the tissue that is present. We then removed the ports, closed the fascial defects with figure-of-eight suture of 3-0 Monocryl, closed the infraumbilical incision with two Monocryl stay sutures to close the fascial sheath, and then used 4-0 Rapide to close the skin defects, and then using Dermabond tissue adhesives, we covered all incisions. At the end of the procedure, the right testis was well descended within the scrotum, and the feeding tube was removed. The patient had IV Toradol and was in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room."
87,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right ureteropelvic junction obstruction.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Right ureteropelvic junction obstruction.2. Severe intraabdominal adhesions.3. Retroperitoneal fibrosis.PROCEDURES PERFORMED:1. Laparoscopic lysis of adhesions.2. Attempted laparoscopic pyeloplasty.3. Open laparoscopic pyeloplasty.ANESTHESIA: General.INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 62-year-old female with a history of right ureteropelvic junction obstruction with chronic indwelling double-J ureteral stent. The patient presents for laparoscopic pyeloplasty.PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operative suite and administered general anesthetic. The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the supine fashion after building up the right side of the OR table to aid in the patient's positioning for bowel retraction. Hassan technique was performed for the initial trocar placement in the periumbilical region. Abdominal insufflation was performed. There were significant adhesions noted. A second 12 mm port was placed in the right midclavicular line at the level of the umbilicus and a Harmonic scalpel was placed through this and adhesiolysis was performed for approximately two-and-half hours, also an additional port was placed 12 mm in the midline between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus, an additional 5 mm port in the right upper quadrant subcostal and midclavicular. After adhesions were taken down, the ascending colon was mobilized by incising the white line of Toldt and mobilizing this medially. The kidney was able to be palpated within Gerota's fascia. The psoas muscle caudate to the inferior pole of the kidney was identified and the tissue overlying this was dissected to the level of the ureter. The uterus was grasped with a Babcock through a trocar port and carried up to the level of the ureteropelvic junction obstruction. The renal pelvis was also identified and dissected free. There was significant fibrosis and scar tissue around the ureteropelvic junction obliterating the tissue planes. We were unable to dissect through this mass of fibrotic tissue safely and therefore the decision was made to abort the laparoscopic procedure and perform the pyeloplasty open. An incision was made from the right upper quadrant port extending towards the midline. This was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, anterior fascia, muscle layers, posterior fascia, and peritoneum. A Bookwalter retractor was placed. The renal pelvis and the ureter were again identified. Fibrotic tissue was able to be dissected away at this time utilizing right angle clamps and Bovie cautery. The tissue was sent down to Pathology for analysis. Please note that upon entering the abdomen, all of the above which was taken down from the adhesions to the abdominal wall were carefully inspected and no evidence of bowel injury was noted. Ureter was divided just distal to the ureteropelvic junction obstruction and stent was maintained in place. The renal pelvis was then opened in a longitudinal manner and excessive pelvis was removed reducing the redundant tissue. At this point, the indwelling double-J ureteral stent was removed. At this time, the ureter was spatulated laterally and at the apex of this spatulation a #4-0 Vicryl suture was placed. This was brought up to the deepened portion of the pyelotomy and cystic structures were approximated. The back wall of the ureteropelvic anastomosis was then approximated with running #4-0 Vicryl suture. At this point, a double-J stent was placed with a guidewire down into the bladder. The anterior wall of the uteropelvic anastomosis was then closed again with a #4-0 running Vicryl suture. Renal sinus fat was then placed around the anastomosis and sutured in place. Please note in the inferior pole of the kidney, there was approximately 2 cm laceration which was identified during the dissection of the fibrotic tissue. This was repaired with horizontal mattress sutures #2-0 Vicryl. FloSeal was placed over this and the renal capsule was placed over this. A good hemostasis was noted. A #10 Blake drain was placed through one of the previous trocar sites and placed into the perirenal space away from the anastomosis. The initial trocar incision was closed with #0 Vicryl suture. The abdominal incision was also then closed with running #0 Vicryl suture incorporating all layers of muscle and fascia. The Scarpa's fascia was then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture. The skin edges were then closed with staples. Please note that all port sites were inspected prior to closing and hemostasis was noted at all sites and the fascia was noted to be reapproximated as these trocar sites were placed with the ________ obturator. We placed the patient on IV antibiotics and pain medications. We will obtain KUB and x-rays for stent placement. Further recommendations to follow."
88,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Benign prostatic hypertrophy.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Benign prostatic hypertrophy.SURGERY: Cystopyelogram and laser vaporization of the prostate.ANESTHESIA: Spinal.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.FLUIDS: Crystalloid.BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of TURP, presented to us with urgency, frequency, and dribbling. The patient was started on alpha-blockers with some help, but had nocturia q.1h. The patient was given anticholinergics with minimal to no help. The patient had a cystoscopy done, which showed enlargement of the left lateral lobes of the prostate. At this point, options were discussed such as watchful waiting and laser vaporization to open up the prostate to get a better stream. Continuation of alpha-blockers and adding another anti-cholinergic at night to prevent bladder overactivity were discussed. The patient was told that his symptoms may be related to the mild-to-moderate trabeculation in the bladder, which can cause poor compliance.The patient understood and wanted to proceed with laser vaporization to see if it would help improve his stream, which in turn might help improve emptying of the bladder and might help his overactivity of the bladder. The patient was told that he may need anticholinergics. There could be increased risk of incontinence, stricture, erectile dysfunction, other complications and the consent was obtained.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was given preoperative antibiotics. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A #23-French scope was inserted inside the urethra into the bladder under direct vision. Bilateral pyelograms were normal. The rest of the bladder appeared normal except for some moderate trabeculations throughout the bladder. There was enlargement of the lateral lobes of the prostate. The old TUR scar was visualized right at the bladder neck. Using diode side-firing fiber, the lateral lobes were taken down. The verumontanum, the external sphincter, and the ureteral openings were all intact at the end of the procedure. Pictures were taken and were shown to the family. At the end of the procedure, there was good hemostasis. A total of about 15 to 20 minutes of lasering time was used. A #22 3-way catheter was placed. At the end of the procedure, the patient was brought to recovery in stable condition. Plan was for removal of the Foley catheter in 48 hours and continuation of use of anticholinergics at night."
89,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left testicular torsion.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left testicular torsion.2. Left testicular abscess.3. Necrotic testes.SURGERY: Left orchiectomy, scrotal exploration, right orchidopexy.DRAINS: Penrose drain on the left hemiscrotum.The patient was given vancomycin, Zosyn, and Levaquin preop.BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 49-year-old male who came into the emergency room with 2-week history of left testicular pain, scrotal swelling, elevated white count of 39,000. The patient had significant scrotal swelling and pain. Ultrasound revealed necrotic testicle. Options such as watchful waiting and removal of the testicle were discussed. Due to elevated white count, the patient was told that he must have the testicle removed due to the infection and possible early signs of urosepsis. The risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, scrotal issues, other complications were discussed. The patient was told about the morbidity and mortality of the procedure and wanted to proceed.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A midline scrotal incision was made. There was very, very thick scrotal skin. There was no necrotic skin. As soon as the left hemiscrotum was entered, significant amount of pus poured out of the left hemiscrotum. The testicle was completely filled with pus and had completely disintegrated with pus. The pus just poured out of the left testicle. The left testicle was completely removed. Debridement was done of the scrotal wall to remove any necrotic tissue. Over 2 L of antibiotic irrigation solution was used to irrigate the left hemiscrotum. There was good tissue left after all the irrigation and debridement. A Penrose drain was placed in the bottom of the left hemiscrotum. I worried about the patient may have torsed and then the testicle became necrotic, so the plan was to pex the right testicle, plus the right side also appeared very abnormal. So, the right hemiscrotum was opened. The testicle had significant amount of swelling and scrotal wall was very thick. The testicle appeared normal. There was no pus coming out of the right hemiscrotum. At this time, a decision was made to place 4-0 Prolene nonabsorbable stitches in 3 different quadrants to prevent it from torsion. The hemiscrotum was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in interrupted stitches and the skin was closed using 2-0 PDS in horizontal mattress. There was very minimal pus left behind and the skin was very healthy. Decision was made to close it to help the patient heal better in the long run. The patient was brought to the recovery in stable condition."
90,Urology,"OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was placed in the supine position under general anesthesia, and prepped and draped in the usual manner. The penis was inspected. The meatus was inspected and an incision was made in the dorsal portion of the meatus up towards the tip of the penis connecting this with the ventral urethral groove. This was incised longitudinally and closed transversely with 5-0 chromic catgut sutures. The meatus was calibrated and accepted the calibrating instrument without difficulty, and there was no stenosis. An incision was made transversely below the meatus in a circumferential way around the shaft of the penis, bringing up the skin of the penis from the corpora. The glans was undermined with sharp dissection and hemostasis was obtained with a Bovie. Using a skin hook, the meatus was elevated ventrally and the glans flaps were reapproximated using 5-0 chromic catgut, creating a new ventral portion of the glans using the flaps of skin. There was good viability of the skin. The incision around the base of the penis was performed, separating the foreskin that was going to be removed from the coronal skin. This was removed and hemostasis was obtained with a Bovie. 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated at the base of the penis for post-op pain relief, and the coronal and penile skin was reanastomosed using 4-0 chromic catgut. At the conclusion of the procedure, Vaseline gauze was wrapped around the penis. There was good hemostasis and the patient was sent to the recovery room in stable condition."
91,Urology,OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was taken to the operating room and was placed in the supine position on the operating room table. A general inhalation anesthetic was administered. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The urethral meatus was calibrated with a small mosquito hemostat and was gently dilated. Next a midline ventral type incision was made opening the meatus. This was done after clamping the tissue to control bleeding. The meatus was opened for about 3 mm. Next the meatus was calibrated and easily calibrated from 8 to 12 French with bougie sounds. Next the mucosal edges were everted and reapproximated to the glans skin edges with approximately five interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures. The meatus still calibrated between 10 and 12 French. Antibiotic ointment was applied. The procedure was terminated. The patient was awakened and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.
92,Urology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient presents today as a consultation from Dr. ABC's office regarding the above. He was seen a few weeks ago for routine followup, and he was noted for microhematuria. Due to his history of kidney stone, renal ultrasound as well as IVP was done. He presents today for followup. He denies any dysuria, gross hematuria or flank pain issues. Last stone episode was over a year ago. No history of smoking. Daytime frequency 3 to 4 and nocturia 1 to 2, good stream, empties well with no incontinence.Creatinine 1.0 on June 25, 2008, UA at that time was noted for 5-9 RBCs, renal ultrasound of 07/24/2008 revealed 6 mm left intrarenal stone, with no hydronephrosis. IVP same day revealed a calcification over the left kidney, but without bilateral hydronephrosis. The calcification previously noted on the ureter appears to be outside the course of the ureter. Otherwise unremarkable. This is discussed.IMPRESSION: 1. A 6-mm left intrarenal stone, nonobstructing, by ultrasound and IVP. The patient is asymptomatic. We have discussed surgical intervention versus observation. He indicates that this stone is not bothersome, prefers observation, need for hydration with a goal of making over 2 liters of urine within 24 hours is discussed.2. Microhematuria, we discussed possible etiologies of this, and the patient is agreeable to cystoscopy in the near future. Urine sent for culture and sensitivity.PLAN: As above. The patient will follow up for cystoscopy, urine sent for cytology, continue hydration. Call if any concern. The patient is seen and evaluated by myself."
93,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Adenocarcinoma of the prostate.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Adenocarcinoma of the prostate.TITLE OF OPERATION: Mini-laparotomy radical retropubic prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection with Cavermap.ANESTHESIA: General by intubation.Informed consent was obtained for the procedure. The patient understands the treatment options and wishes to proceed. He accepts the risks to include bleeding requiring transfusion, infection, sepsis, incontinence, impotence, bladder neck constricture, heart attack, stroke, pulmonary emboli, phlebitis, injury to the bladder, rectum, or ureter, etcetera.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the Operating Room and placed in the supine position, prepped with Betadine solution and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 20- French Foley catheter was inserted into the penis and into the bladder and placed to dependent drainage. The table was then placed in minimal flexed position. A midline skin incision was then made from the umbilicus to the symphysis pubis. It was carried down to the anterior rectus fascia into the pelvis proper. Both obturator fossae were exposed. Standard bilateral pelvic lymph node dissections were carried out. The left side was approached first by myself. The limits of my dissection were from the external iliac vein laterally to the obturator nerve medially, and from the bifurcation of the common iliac vein proximally to Cooper's ligament distally. Meticulous lymphostasis and hemostasis was obtained using hemoclips and 2-0 silk ligatures. The obturator nerve was visualized throughout and was not injured. The right side was carried out by my assistant under my direct and constant supervision. Again, the obturator nerve was visualized throughout and it was not injured. Both packets were sent to Pathology where no evidence of carcinoma was found.My attention was then directed to the prostate itself. The endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally. Using gentle dissection with a Kitner, I swept the levator muscles off the prostate and exposed the apical portion of the prostate. A back bleeding control suture of 0 Vicryl was placed at the mid-prostate level. A sternal wire was then placed behind the dorsal vein complex which was sharply transected. The proximal and distal portions of this complex were then oversewn with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion. When I was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, my attention was then turned to the neurovascular bundles.The urethra was then sharply transected and six sutures of 2-0 Monocryl placed at the 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 o'clock positions. The prostate was then lifted retrograde in the field and was swept from the anterior surface of the rectum and the posterior layer of Denonvilliers' fascia was incised distally, swept off the rectum and incorporated with the prostate specimen. The lateral pedicles over the seminal vesicles were then mobilized, hemoclipped and transected. The seminal vesicles themselves were then mobilized and hemostasis obtained using hemoclips. Ampullae of the vas were mobilized, hemoclipped and transected. The bladder neck was then developed using careful blunt and sharp dissection. The prostate was then transected at the level of the bladder neck and sent for permanent specimen. The bladder neck was reevaluated and the ureteral orifices were found to be placed well back from the edge. The bladder neck was reconstructed in standard fashion. It was closed using a running 2-0 Vicryl. The mucosa was everted over the edge of the bladder neck using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture. At the end of this portion of the case, the new bladder neck had a stoma-like appearance and would accommodate easily my small finger. The field was then re-evaluated for hemostasis which was further obtained using hemoclips, Bovie apparatus and 3-0 chromic ligatures. When I was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, the aforementioned Monocryl sutures were then placed at the corresponding positions in the bladder neck. A new 20-French Foley catheter was brought in through the urethra into the bladder. A safety suture of 0 Prolene was brought through the end of this and out through a separate stab wound in the bladder and through the left lateral quadrant. The table was taken out of flexion and the bladder was then brought into approximation to the urethra and the Monocryl sutures were ligated. The bladder was then copiously irrigated with sterile water and the anastomosis was found to be watertight. The pelvis was also copiously irrigated with 2 liters of sterile water. A 10-French Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the pelvis and brought out through the right lower quadrant and sutured in place with a 2-0 silk ligature.The wound was then closed in layers. The muscle was closed with a running 0 chromic, the fascia with a running 1-0 Vicryl, the subcutaneous tissue with 3-0 plain, and the skin with a running 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular. Steri-Strips were applied and a sterile dressing.The patient was taken to the Recovery Room in good condition. There were no complications. Sponge and instrument counts were reported correct at the end of the case."
94,Urology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient presents today as a consultation from Dr. ABC's office regarding the above. He has history of neurogenic bladder, and on intermittent self-catheterization 3 times a day. However, June 24, 2008, he was seen in the ER, and with fever, weakness, possible urosepsis. He had a blood culture, which was positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis, as well as urine culture noted for same bacteria. He was treated on IV antibiotics, Dr. XYZ also saw the patient. Discharged home. Not taking any antibiotics. Today in the office, the patient denies any dysuria, gross hematuria, fever, chills. He is catheterizing 3 times a day, changing his catheter weekly. Does have history of renal transplant, which has been followed by Dr. X and is on chronic steroids. Renal ultrasound, June 23, 2008, was noted for mild hydronephrosis of renal transplant with fluid in the pericapsular space. Creatinine, July 7, 2008 was 2.0, BUN 36, and patient tells me this is being followed by Dr. X. No interval complaints today, no issues with catheterization or any gross hematuria.IMPRESSION: 1. Neurogenic bladder, in a patient catheterizing himself 3 times a day, changing his catheter 3 times a week, we again reviewed the technique of catheterization, and he has no issues with this.2. Recurrent urinary tract infection, in a patient who has been hospitalized twice within the last few months, he is on steroids for renal transplant, which has most likely been overall reducing his immune system. He is asymptomatic today. No complaints today.PLAN: Following a detailed discussion with the patient, we elected to proceed with intermittent self-catheterization, changing catheter weekly, and technique has been discussed as above. Based on the recent culture, we will place him on Keflex nighttime prophylaxis, for the next three months or so. He will call if any concerns. Follow up as previously scheduled in September for re-assessment. All questions answered. The patient is seen and evaluated by myself."
95,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Refractory urgency and frequency.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Refractory urgency and frequency.OPERATION: Stage I and II neuromodulator.ANESTHESIA: Local MAC.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.FLUIDS: Crystalloid. The patient was given Ancef preop antibiotic. Ancef irrigation was used throughout the procedure.BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 63-year-old female who presented to us with urgency and frequency on physical exam. There was no evidence of cystocele or rectocele. On urodyanamcis, the patient has significant overactivity of the bladder. The patient was tried on over three to four different anticholinergic agents such as Detrol, Ditropan, Sanctura, and VESIcare for at least one month each. The patient had pretty much failure from each of the procedure. The patient had less than 20% improvement with anticholinergics. Options such as continuously trying anticholinergics, continuation of the Kegel exercises, and trial of InterStim were discussed. The patient was interested in the trial. The patient had percutaneous InterStim trial in the office with over 70% to 80% improvement in her urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence. The patient was significantly satisfied with the results and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator. Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed. Risk of failure of the procedure in the future was discussed.Risk of lead migration that the treatment may or may not work in the long-term basis and data on the long term were not clear were discussed with the patient. The patient understood and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator. Consent was obtained.DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the OR. The patient was placed in prone position. A pillow was placed underneath her pelvis area to slightly lift the pelvis up. The patient was awake, was given some MAC anesthesia through the IV, but the patient was talking and understanding and was able to verbalize issues. The patient's back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Lidocaine 1% was applied on the right side near the S3 foramen. Under fluoroscopy, the needle placement was confirmed. The patient felt stimulation in the vaginal area, which was tapping in nature. The patient also had a pressure feeling in the vaginal area. The patient had no back sensation or superficial sensation. There was no sensation down the leg. The patient did have __________, which turned in slide bellows response indicating the proper positioning of the needle. A wire was placed. The tract was dilated and lead was placed. The patient felt tapping in the vaginal area, which is an indication that the lead is in its proper position. Most of the leads had very low amplitude and stimulation. Lead was tunneled under the skin and was brought out through an incision on the left upper buttocks. Please note that the lidocaine was injected prior to the tunneling. A pouch was created about 1 cm beneath the subcutaneous tissue over the muscle where the actual unit was connected to the lead. Screws were turned and they were dropped. Attention was made to ensure that the lead was all the way in into the InterStim. Irrigation was performed after placing the main unit in the pouch. Impedance was checked. Irrigation was again performed with antibiotic irrigation solution. The needle site was closed using 4-0 Monocryl. The pouch was closed using 4-0 Vicryl and the subcutaneous tissue with 4-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied.The patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition."
96,Urology,"BILATERAL SCROTAL ORCHECTOMYPROCEDURE:: The patient is placed in the supine position, prepped and draped in the usual manner. Under satisfactory general anesthesia, the scrotum was approached and through a transverse mid scrotal incision, the right testicle was delivered through the incision. Hemostasis was obtained with the Bovie and the spermatic cord was identified. It was clamped, suture ligated with 0 chromic catgut and the cord above was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine for postoperative pain relief. The left testicle was delivered through the same incision. The spermatic cord was identified, clamped, suture ligated and that cord was also injected with 0.25% percent Marcaine. The incision was injected with the same material and then closed in two layers using 4-0 chromic catgut continuous for the dartos and interrupted for the skin. A dry sterile dressing fluff and scrotal support applied over that. The patient was sent to the Recovery Room in stable condition."
97,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Nonpalpable right undescended testis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Nonpalpable right undescended testis with atrophic right testis.PROCEDURES: Examination under anesthesia, diagnostic laparoscopy, right orchiectomy, and left testis fixation.ANESTHESIA: General inhalation anesthetic with caudal block.FLUID RECEIVED: 250 mL of crystalloids.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL.SPECIMEN: The tissue sent to Pathology was right testicular remnant.ABNORMAL FINDINGS: Closed ring on right with atrophic vessels going into the ring and there was obstruction at the shoulder of the ring. Left had open appearing ring but the scrotum was not filled and vas and vessels going into the ring.INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 2-year-old boy with a right nonpalpable undescended testis. The plan is for evaluation and repair.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed. The patient was placed in supine position and examined. The left testis well within scrotum. The right was again not palpable despite the patient being asleep with multiple attempts to check.The patient was then sterilely prepped and draped. An 8-French feeding tube was then placed within his bladder through the urethra and attached to the drainage. We then incised the infraumbilical area once he was sterilely prepped and draped, with 15 blade knife, then using Hasson technique with stay stitches in the anterior and posterior rectus fascia sheath of 3-0 Monocryl. We entered the peritoneum with the 5-mm one-step system. We then used the short 0-degree lens for laparoscopy. We then insufflated with carbon dioxide insufflation to pressure of 12 mmHg. There was no bleeding noted upon evaluation of the abdomen and again the findings were as mentioned with closed ring with vas and vessels going to the left and vessels and absent vas on the right where the closed ring was found. Because there was no testis found in the abdomen, we then evacuated the gas and closed the fascial sheath with the 3-0 Monocryl tacking sutures. Then skin was closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 Rapide. A curvilinear upper scrotal incision was made on the right with 15 blade knife and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis. A curved tenotomy scissor was used to open the sac. The tunica vaginalis was visualized and grasped and then dissected up towards external ring. There was no apparent testicular tissue. We did remove it, however, tying off the cord structure with a 4-0 Vicryl suture and putting a tagging suture at the base of the tissue sent. We then closed the subdartos area with the subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic. We then did a similar curvilinear incision on the left side for testicular fixation. Delivered the testis into the field, which had a type III epididymal attachment and was indeed about 3 to 4 mL in size, which was larger than expected for the patient's age. We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with the 4-0 chromic pursestring suture and placed testis back into the scrotum in the proper orientation and closed the dartos, skin, and subcutaneous closure with 4-0 chromic on left hemiscrotum. At the end of the procedure, the patient received IV Toradol and had Dermabond tissue adhesive placed on both incisions and left testis was well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure. The patient tolerated procedure well, and was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room."
98,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ectopic left testis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ectopic left testis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Left orchiopexy.ANESTHESIA: General. The patient did receive Ancef.INDICATIONS AND CONSENT: This is a 16-year-old African-American male who had an ectopic left testis that severed approximately one-and-a-half years ago. The patient did have an MRI, which confirmed ectopic testis located near the pubic tubercle. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the proposed procedure were discussed with the patient. Informed consent was on the chart at the time of procedure.PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient did receive Ancef antibiotics prior to the procedure. He was then wheeled to the operative suite where a general anesthetic was administered. He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and shaved in the area of the intended procedure. Next, with a #15 blade scalpel, an oblique skin incision was made over the spermatic cord region. The fascia was then dissected down both bluntly and sharply and hemostasis was maintained with Bovie electrocautery. The fascia of the external oblique, creating the external ring was then encountered and that was grasped in two areas with hemostats and sized with Metzenbaum scissors. This was then continued to open the external ring and was then carried cephalad to further open the external ring, exposing the spermatic cord. With this accomplished, the testis was then identified. It was located over the left pubic tubercle region and soft tissue was then meticulously dissected and cared to avoid all vascular and testicular structures.The cord length was then achieved by applying some tension to the testis and further dissecting any of the fascial adhesions along the spermatic cord. Once again, meticulous care was maintained not to involve any neurovascular or contents of the testis or vas deferens. Weitlaner retractor was placed to provide further exposure. There was a small vein encountered posterior to the testis and this was then hemostated into place and cut with Metzenbaum scissors and doubly ligated with #3-0 Vicryl. Again hemostasis was maintained with ligation and Bovie electrocautery with adequate mobilization of the spermatic cord and testis. Next, bluntly a tunnel was created through the subcutaneous tissue into the left empty scrotal compartment. This was taken down to approximately the two-thirds length of the left scrotal compartment. Once this tunnel has been created, a #15 blade scalpel was then used to make transverse incision. A skin incision through the scrotal skin and once again the skin edges were grasped with Allis forceps and the dartos was then entered with the Bovie electrocautery exposing the scrotal compartment. Once this was achieved, the apices of the dartos were then grasped with hemostats and supra-dartos pouch was then created using the Iris scissors. A dartos pouch was created between the skin and the supra-dartos, both cephalad and caudad to the level of the scrotal incision. A hemostat was then placed from inferior to superior through the created tunnel and the testis was pulled through the created supra-dartos pouch ensuring that anatomic position was in place, maintaining the epididymis posterolateral without any rotation of the cord. With this accomplished, #3-0 Prolene was then used to tack both the medial and lateral aspects of the testis to the remaining dartos into the tunica vaginalis. The sutures were then tied creating the orchiopexy. The remaining body of the testicle was then tucked into the supra-dartos pouch and the skin was then approximated with #4-0 undyed Monocryl in a horizontal mattress fashion interrupted sutures. Once again hemostasis was maintained with Bovie electrocautery. Finally the attention was made towards the inguinal incision and this was then copiously irrigated and any remaining bleeders were then fulgurated with Bovie electrocautery to make sure to avoid any neurovascular spermatic structures. External ring was then recreated and grasped on each side with hemostats and approximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion cephalad to caudad. Once this was created, the created ring was inspected and there was adequate room for the cord. There appeared to be no evidence of compression. Finally, subcutaneous layer with sutures of #4-0 interrupted chromic was placed and then the skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion. The patient had been injected with bupivacaine prior to closing the skin. Finally, the patient was cleansed.The scrotal support was placed and plan will the for the patient to take Keflex one tablet q.i.d. x7 days as well as Tylenol #3 for severe pain and Motrin for moderate pain as well as applying ice packs to scrotum. He will follow up with Dr. X in 10 to 14 days. Appointment will be made."
99,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral undescended testes.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral undescended testes.OPERATION PERFORMED: Bilateral orchiopexy.ANESTHESIA: General.HISTORY: This 8-year-old boy has been found to have a left inguinally situated undescended testes. Ultrasound showed metastasis to be high in the left inguinal canal. The right testis is located in the right inguinal canal on ultrasound and apparently ultrasound could not be displaced into the right hemiscrotum. Both testes appeared to be normal in size for the boy's age.OPERATIVE FINDINGS: As above, both testes appeared viable and normal in size, no masses. There is a hernia on the left side. The spermatic cord was quite short on the left and required Prentiss Maneuver to achieve adequate length for scrotal placement.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The boy was taken to the operating room, where he was placed on the operating table. General anesthesia was administered by Dr. X, after which the boy's lower abdomen and genitalia were prepared with Betadine and draped aseptically. A 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated subcutaneously in the skin crease in the left groin in the area of the intended incision. An inguinal incision was then made through this area, carried through the subcutaneous tissues to the anterior fascia. External ring was exposed with dissection as well. The fascia was opened in direction of its fibers exposing the testes, which lay high in the canal. The testes were freed with dissection by removing cremasteric and spermatic fascia. The hernia sac was separated from the cord, twisted and suture ligated at the internal ring. Lateral investing bands of the spermatic cords were divided high into the inguinal internal ring. However, this would only allow placement of the testes in the upper scrotum with some tension.Therefore, the left inguinal canal was incised and the inferior epigastric artery and vein were ligated with #4-0 Vicryl and divided. This maneuver allowed for placement of the testes in the upper scrotum without tension.A sub dartos pouch was created by separating the abdominal fascia from the scrotal skin after making an incision in the left hemiscrotum in the direction of the vessel. The testes were then brought into the pouch and anchored with interrupted #4-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was approximated with interrupted #5-0 chromic catgut sutures. Inspection of the spermatic cord in the inguinal area revealed no twisting and the testicular cover was good. Internal oblique muscle was approximated to the shelving edge and Poupart ligament with interrupted #4-0 Vicryl over the spermatic cord and the external oblique fascia was closed with running #4-0 Vicryl suture. Additional 7 mL of Marcaine was infiltrated subfascially and the skin was closed with running #5-0 subcuticular after placing several #4-0 Vicryl approximating sutures in the subcutaneous tissues.Attention was then turned to the opposite side, where an orchiopexy was performed in a similar fashion. However, on this side, there was no inguinal hernia. The testes were located in a superficial pouch of the inguinal canal and there was adequate length on the spermatic cord, so that the Prentiss maneuver was not required on this side. The sub dartos pouch was created in a similar fashion and the wounds were closed similarly as well.The inguinal and scrotal incisions were cleansed after completion of the procedure. Steri-Strips and Tegaderm were applied to the inguinal incisions and collodion to the scrotal incision. The child was then awakened and transported to post-anesthetic recovery area apparently in satisfactory condition. Instrument and sponge counts were correct. There were no apparent complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 20 to 30 mL."
100,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left undescended testis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left undescended testis plus left inguinal hernia.PROCEDURES: Left inguinal hernia repair, left orchiopexy with 0.25% Marcaine, ilioinguinal nerve block and wound block at 0.5% Marcaine plain.ABNORMAL FINDINGS: A high left undescended testis with a type III epididymal attachment along with vas.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL.FLUIDS RECEIVED: 1100 mL of crystalloid.TUBES/DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used.COUNTS: Sponge and needle counts were correct x2.SPECIMENS: No tissues sent to Pathology.ANESTHESIA: General inhalational anesthetic.INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is an 11-1/2-year-old boy with an undescended testis on the left. The plan is for repair.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position, and sterilely prepped and draped. A superior curvilinear scrotal incision was then made in the left hemiscrotum with a 15-blade knife and further extended with electrocautery into the subcutaneous tissue. We then used the curved cryoclamp to dissect into the scrotal space and found the tunica vaginalis and dissected this up to the external ring. We were able to dissect all the way up to the ring, but were unable to get the testis delivered. We then made a left inguinal incision with a 15-blade knife, further extending with electrocautery through Scarpa fascia down to the external oblique fascia. The testis again was not visualized in the external ring, so we brought the sac up from the scrotum into the inguinal incision and then incised the external oblique fascia with a 15-blade knife further extending with Metzenbaum scissors. The testis itself was quite high up in the upper canal. We then dissected the gubernacular structures off of the testis, and also, then opened the sac, and dissected the sac off and found that he had a communicating hernia hydrocele and dissected the sac off with curved and straight mosquitos and a straight Joseph scissors. Once this was dissected off and up towards the internal ring, it was twisted upon itself and suture ligated with an 0 Vicryl suture. We then dissected the lateral spermatic fascia, and then, using blunt dissection, dissected in the retroperitoneal space to get more cord length. We also dissected the sac from the peritoneal reflection up into the abdomen once it had been tied off. We then found that we had an adequate amount of cord length to get the testis in the mid-to-low scrotum. The patient was found to have a type III epididymal attachment with a long looping vas, and we brought the testis into the scrotum in the proper orientation and tacked it to mid-to-low scrotum with a 4-0 chromic stay stitch. The upper aspect of the subdartos pouch was closed with a 4-0 chromic pursestring suture. The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation. We then placed the local anesthetic, and the ilioinguinal nerve block, and placed a small amount in both incisional areas as well. We then closed the external oblique fascia with a running suture of 0-Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and cord structures were not bottom closure. The Scarpa fascia was closed with a 4-0 chromic suture, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure. Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on the both incisions, and IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well, was in a stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room."
101,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right undescended testis (ectopic position).POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Right undescended testis (ectopic position), right inguinal hernia.PROCEDURES: Right orchiopexy and right inguinal hernia repair.ANESTHESIA: General inhalational anesthetic with caudal block.FLUIDS RECEIVED: 100 mL of crystalloids.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL.SPECIMENS: No tissues sent to pathology.TUBES AND DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used.INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is an almost 4-year-old boy with an undescended testis on the right; plan is for repair.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room; surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed. He was then placed in the supine position and sterilely prepped and draped. Since the testis was in the ectopic position, we did an upper curvilinear scrotal incision with a 15-blade knife and further extended it with electrocautery. Electrocautery was also used for hemostasis. A subdartos pouch was then created with a curved tenotomy scissors. The tunica vaginalis was grasped with a curved mosquito clamp and then dissected from its gubernacular attachments. As we were dissecting it, we then found the testis itself into the sac, and we opened the sac, and it was found to be slightly atrophic about 12 mm in length and had a type III epididymal attachment, not being attached to the top. We then dissected the hernia sac off of the testis __________ some traction using the straight Joseph scissors and straight and curved mosquito clamps. Once this was dissected off, we then twisted it upon itself, and then dissected it down towards the external ring, but on traction. We then twisted it upon itself, suture ligated it with 3-0 Vicryl and released it, allowing it to spring back into the canal. Once this was done, we then had adequate length of the testis into the scrotal sac. Using a curved mosquito clamp, we grasped the base of the scrotum internally, and using the subcutaneous tissue, we tacked it to the base of the testis using a 4-0 chromic suture. The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation. The upper aspect of the pouch was closed with a pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic. The scrotal skin and dartos were then closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic, and Dermabond tissue adhesive was used on the incision. IV Toradol was given. Both testes were well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure."
102,Urology,"OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating room table. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. An incision was made in the groin crease overlying the internal ring. This incision was about 1.5 cm in length. The incision was carried down through the Scarpa's layer to the level of the external oblique. This was opened along the direction of its fibers and carried down along the external spermatic fascia. The cremasteric fascia was then incised and the internal spermatic fascia was grasped and pulled free. A hernia sac was identified and the testicle was located. Next the internal spermatic fascia was incised and the hernia sac was dissected free inside the internal ring. This was performed by incising the transversalis fascia circumferentially. The hernia sac was ligated with a 3-0 silk suture high and divided and was noted to retract into the abdominal cavity. Care was taken not to injure the testicular vessels. Next the abnormal attachments of the testicle were dissected free distally with care not to injure any long loop vas and these were divided beneath the testicle for a fair distance. The lateral attachments tethering the cord vessels were freed from the sidewalls in the retroperitoneum high. This gave excellent length and very adequate length to bring the testicle down into the anterior superior hemiscrotum. The testicle was viable. This was wrapped in a moist sponge.Next a hemostat was passed down through the inguinal canal down into the scrotum. A small 1 cm incision was made in the anterior superior scrotal wall. Dissection was carried down through the dartos layer. A subdartos pouch was formed with blunt dissection. The hemostat was then pushed against the tissues and this tissue was divided. The hemostat was then passed through the incision. A Crile hemostat was passed back up into the inguinal canal. The distal attachments of the sac were grasped and pulled down without twisting these structures through the incision. The neck was then closed with a 4-0 Vicryl suture that was not too tight, but tight enough to prevent retraction of the testicle. The testicle was then tucked down in its proper orientation into the subdartos pouch and the subcuticular tissue was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was closed with a running 6-0 subcuticular chromic suture. Benzoin and a Steri-Strip were placed. Next the transversus abdominis arch was reapproximated to the iliopubic tract over the top of the cord vessels to tighten up the ring slightly. This was done with 2 to 3 interrupted 3-0 silk sutures. The external oblique was then closed with interrupted 3-0 silk suture. The Scarpa's layer was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was then closed with a running 4-0 Vicryl intracuticular stitch. Benzoin and Steri-Strip were applied. The testicle was in good position in the dependent portion of the hemiscrotum and the patient had a caudal block, was awakened, and was returned to the recovery room in stable condition."
103,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right undescended testicle.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right undescended testicle.OPERATIONS:1. Right orchiopexy.2. Right herniorrhaphy.ANESTHESIA: LMA.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.SPECIMEN: Sac.BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 10-year-old male who presented to us with his mom with consultation from Craig Connor at Cottonwood with right undescended testis. The patient and mother had seen the testicle in the right hemiscrotum in the past, but the testicle seemed to be sliding. The testis was identified right at the external inguinal ring. The testis was unable to be brought down into the scrotal sac. The patient could have had sliding testicle in the past and now the testis has become undescended as the child has grown. Options such as watchful waiting and wait for puberty to stimulate the descent of the testicle, HCG stimulation, orchiopexy were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, etc. were discussed. The patient and parents understood and wanted to proceed with right orchiopexy and herniorrhaphy.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the OR, anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in supine position. The patient was prepped and draped in the inguinal and scrotal area. After the patient was prepped and draped, an inguinal incision was made on the right side about 1 cm away for the anterior superior iliac spine going towards the external ring over the inguinal canal. The incision came through the subcutaneous tissue and external oblique fascia was identified. The external oblique fascia was opened sharply and was taken all the way down towards the external ring. The ilioinguinal nerve was identified right underneath the external oblique fascia, which was preserved and attention was drawn throughout the entire case to ensure that it was not under any tension or pinched or got hooked in the suture. After dissecting proximally, the testis was identified in the distal end of the inguinal canal. The testis was pulled up. The cremasteric muscle was divided and dissection was carried all the way up to the internal inguinal ring. There was very small hernia, which was removed and was tied at the base. PDS suture was used to tie this hernia sac all the way up to the base. There was a Y right at the vas and cord indicating there was enough length into the scrotal sac. The testis was easily brought down into the scrotal sac. One centimeter superior scrotal incision was made and a Dartos pouch was created. The testicle was brought down into the pouch and was placed into the pouch. Careful attention was done to ensure that there was no torsion of the cord. The vas was medial all the way throughout and the cord was lateral all the way throughout. The epididymis was in the posterolateral location. The testicle was pexed using 4-0 Vicryl into the scrotal sac. Skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl. The external oblique fascia was closed using 2-0 PDS. Attention was drawn to re-create the external inguinal ring. A small finger was easily placed in the external inguinal ring to ensure that there was no tightening of the cord. Marcaine 0.25% was applied, about 15 mL worth of this was applied for local anesthesia. After closing the external oblique fascia, the Scarpa was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion. Dermabond and Steri-Strips were applied.The patient was brought to recovery room in stable condition at the end of the procedure.Please note that the testicle was viable. It was smaller than the other side, probably by 50%. There were no palpable testicular masses. Plan was for the patient to follow up with us in about 1 month. The patient was told not to do any heavy lifting for at least 3 months, okay to shower in 48 hours. No tub bath for 2 months. The patient and family understood all the instructions."
104,Urology,"REASON FOR VISIT: Overactive bladder with microscopic hematuria.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 56-year-old noted to have microscopic hematuria with overactive bladder. Her cystoscopy performed was unremarkable. She continues to have some episodes of frequency and urgency mostly with episodes during the day and rare at night. No gross hematuria, dysuria, pyuria, no other outlet obstructive and/or irritative voiding symptoms. The patient had been previously on Ditropan and did not do nearly as well. At this point, what we will try is a different medication. Renal ultrasound is otherwise unremarkable, notes no evidence of any other disease.IMPRESSION: Overactive bladder with microscopic hematuria most likely some mild atrophic vaginitis is noted. She has no other significant findings other than her overactive bladder, which had continued. At this juncture what I would like to do is try a different anticholinergic medication. She has never had any side effects from her medication.PLAN: The patient will discontinue Ditropan. We will start Sanctura XR and we will follow up as scheduled. Otherwise we will continue to follow her urinalysis over the next year or so."
105,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Phimosis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Phimosis.PROCEDURE: Reduction of paraphimosis.ANESTHESIA: General inhalation anesthetic with 0.25% Marcaine, penile block and ring block about 20 mL given.FLUIDS RECEIVED: 100 mL.SPECIMENS: No tissues sent to pathology.COUNTS: Sponge and needle counts were not necessary.TUBES/DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used.FINDINGS: Paraphimosis with moderate swelling.INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 15-year-old boy who had acute alcohol intoxication had his foreskin retracted with a Foley catheter placed at another institution. When they removed the catheter they forgot to reduce the foreskin and he developed paraphimosis. The plan is for reduction.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, with manual pressure and mobilization of the shaft skin we were able to reduce the paraphimosis. Using Betadine and alcohol cleanse, we then did a dorsal penile block and a ring block by surgeon with 0.25% Marcaine, 20 mL were given. He did quite well after the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."

107,Urology,"DateXYZ, M.D. Suite 123, ABC Avenue City, STATE 12345 RE: XXXX, XXXX MR#: 0000000Dear Dr. XYZ: XXXX was seen in followup in the Pediatric Urology Clinic. I appreciate you speaking with me while he was in clinic. He continues to have abdominal pain, and he had a diuretic renal scan, which indicates no evidence of obstruction and good differential function bilaterally. When I examined him, he seems to indicate that his pain is essentially in the lower abdomen in the suprapubic region; however, on actual physical examination, he seems to complain of pain through his entire right side. His parents have brought up the question of whether this could be gastrointestinal in origin and that is certainly an appropriate consideration. They also feel that since he has been on Detrol, his pain levels have been somewhat worse, and so, I have given them the option of stopping the Detrol initially. I think he should stay on MiraLax for management of his bowels. I would also suggest that he be referred to Pediatric Gastroenterology for evaluation. If they do not find any abnormalities from a gastrointestinal perspective, then the next step would be to endoscope his bladder and then make sure that he does not have any evidence of bladder anatomic abnormalities that is leading to this pain. Thank you for following XXXX along with us in Pediatric Urology Clinic. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Sincerely yours,"
108,Urology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Penile cellulitis status post circumcision.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 16-month-old boy, who had a circumcision performed approximately 4 days before he developed penile swelling and fever and discharge. The child initially had a newborn circumcision at about 1 week of life and then developed a concealed or buried penis with extra skin and tightness of the skin. He underwent a second circumcision with a general anesthetic approximately 8 to 9 days ago. The mother states that on Thursday, he developed fairly significant swelling, scrotum was also swollen, the suprapubic region was swollen, and he was having a purulent discharge and a fairly significant fever to 102 to 103. He was seen at Hospital, transferred to Children's Hospital for further care. Since being hospitalized, his cultures apparently have grown Staph but is unknown yet whether it is methicillin-resistant. He has been placed on clindamycin, and he is now currently afebrile and with marked improvement according to the mother. I was requested a consultation by Dr. X because of the appearance of penis. The patient has been voiding without difficulty throughout.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has no known allergies. He was a term delivery via vaginal delivery. Surgeries; he has had 2 circumcisions. No other hospitalizations. He has had no heart murmurs, seizures, asthma, or bronchitis.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A 14-point review of systems was negative with the exception of the penile and scrotal cellulitis and the surgeries as mentioned. He also had an ear infection about 1 to 2 weeks before his circumcision.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with both parents and no siblings. There are smokers at home.MEDICATIONS: Clindamycin and bacitracin ointment. Also Bactrim.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: Weight is 14.9 kg.GENERAL: The patient was sleepy but easily arousable.HEAD AND NECK: Grossly normal. His neck and chest are without masses.NARES: He had some crusted nares; otherwise, no other discharge.LUNGS: Clear.CARDIAC: Without murmurs or gallops.ABDOMEN: Soft without masses or tenderness.GU: He has a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad, and he is quite a large child in any event; however, there were no signs of erythema. There was some induration around the penis; however, there were no signs of active infection. He has a buried appearance of the penis after recent circumcision with a normal appearing glans. The tissue itself, however, was quite dull and is soft or readily retractable at this time. The scrotum was normal, and there was no erythema, there was no tenderness. Both testes were descended without hydroceles.EXTREMITIES: He has full range of motion of all 4 extremities.SKIN: Warm, pink, and dry.NEUROLOGIC: Grossly intact.BACK: Normal.IMPRESSION/PLAN: The patient had a recent circumcision with a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad but also has a penile and suprapubic cellulitis. This is being treated, but it is most likely Staph and pending sensitivities. I talked to the mother and told her that at this point the swelling that is present is a mixture of the resolving cellulitis from a suprapubic fat pad. I recommended that he be treated most likely with Bactrim for a 10-day course at home, bacitracin, or some antibiotics ointment to the penis with each diaper change for the next 2 to 3 weeks with sitz bath once or twice a day. I told the mother that initially the tissues are going to be quite dull because of the infection and the recent surgery, but she ultimately will have to gently retract the skin to keep it from adhering again because of the prominent suprapubic fat pad, which makes it more likely. Otherwise, it is a fairly healthy-appearing tissue at the present time and she knows the reasons that he cannot be discharged once the hospitalist service believes that it is appropriate to do so. He has a scheduled followup appointment with his urologist and he should keep that appointment or followup sooner if there is any other problem arising."
109,Urology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Penile discharge, infected-looking glans.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67-year-old African-American male, who was recently discharged from the hospital on July 21, 2008 after being admitted for altered mental status and before that after undergoing right above knee amputation for wet gangrene. The patient was transferred to Nursing Home and presents today from the nursing home with complaints of bleeding from the right AKA stump and penile discharge. As per the patient during his hospitalizations over here, he had indwelling Foley catheter for a few days and when he was discharged at the nursing home he was discharged without the catheter. However, the patient was brought back to the ED today when he suffered fall yesterday and started bleeding from his stump. While placing the catheter in the ED on retraction of foreskin purulent discharge was seen from the penis and the glans appeared infected, so urology consult was placed.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative except as in the HPI.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for end-stage renal disease on dialysis, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Right AKAMEDICATIONS: Novolin, Afrin, Nephro-Vite, Neurontin, lisinopril, furosemide, Tums, labetolol, Plavix, nitroglycerin, Aricept, omeprazole, oxycodone, Norvasc, Renagel, and morphine.ALLERGIES: PENICILLIN and ADHESIVE TAPE.FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, and myocardial infarction.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone. He is unemployed, disabled. He has history of tobacco use in the past. He denies alcohol or drug abuse.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: A well-appearing African-American male lying comfortably in bed, in acute distress.NECK: Supple.LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.CARDIOVASCULAR: S1 and S2, normal.ABDOMEN: Soft, nondistended, and nontender.GENITOURINARY: Penis is not circumcised. Currently, indwelling Foley catheter in place. On retraction of the foreskin, pale-looking glans tip with areas of yellow-white tissue. The proximal glans appeared pink. The patient currently has indwelling Foley catheter and glans slightly tender to touch. However, no purulent discharge was seen on compression of the glans. Otherwise on palpation, no other deformity noticed. Bilateral testes descended. No palpable abnormality. No evidence of infection in his perineal area.EXTREMITIES: Right AKA.NEUROLOGIC: Awake, alert, and oriented. No sensory or motor deficit.LABORATORY DATA: I independently reviewed the lab work done on the patient. The patient had a UA done in the ED which showed few bacteria, white blood cells 6 to 12, and a few epithelial cells which were negative. His basic metabolic panel with creatinine of 7.2 and potassium of 5, otherwise normal. CBC with a white blood cell count of 11.5, hemoglobin of 9.5, and INR of 1.13.IMPRESSION: A 67-year-old male with multiple comorbidities with penile discharge and pale-appearing glans. It seems that the patient has had multiple catheterizations recently and has history of peripheral vascular disease. I think it is due to chronic ischemic changes.RECOMMENDATIONS: Our recommendation would be:1. To remove the Foley catheter.2. Local hygiene.3. Local application of bacitracin ointment.4. Antibiotic for urinary tract infection.5. Follow up as needed. Of note, it was explained to the patient that the appearance of this glans may improve or may get worsened but at this point, there is no indication to operate on him. If increased purulent discharge, the patient was asked to call us sooner, otherwise follow up as scheduled."
110,Urology,"REASON FOR ADMISSION: Penile injury and continuous bleeding from a penile laceration.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 18-year-old detainee who was brought by police officers because of a penile injury and bleeding. He is otherwise healthy. He tried to insert a marble in his penis four days ago. He told me that he grabbed the skin on the top of the penis and moved it away from the penis shaft and then using a toothbrush that he made in to a knife object he pierced the skin through from both sides and then kept moving the toothbrush to dilate and make a way for the marble. Then he inserted a heart-shaped marble in one of the puncture wounds and inserted it under the skin and kept it there. He was not significantly bleeding and essentially the bleeding stopped from both puncture wounds that he has. Then today four days after that procedure, he was taking a bath today and he thinks because of the weight he felt a gush in his pants and he looked and he saw the bleeding come out. He was bleeding so much that he started dripping to the sides of his legs. So, he was brought to the hospital. Actually after being seen by two nurses at the facility where he was at the detention center where he was at and they actually did the dressing twice and it was twice soaked with blood. He came here and was continuously bleeding from that area that we had to change the dressing twice and he is actually still bleeding especially from one of the laceration, the one on the right side of the penis. The marble also still can be felt underneath the skin. There is no urethral bleeding. He did urinate today without difficulty, without hematuria or dysuria. There is pain in the lacerations. No erythema in the skin or swelling in the penis and no other injuries. He did this procedure for sexual pleasure as he said.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Unremarkable.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Tonsillectomy.MEDICATION: He took only ibuprofen. No regular medication.ALLERGIES: None.SOCIAL HISTORY: He has been in detention for two months for immigration problems. No drugs. No alcohol. No smoking. He used to work in fast food chain.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory to this illness.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Aside from the pain in the penis and continuous bleeding, he is basically asymptomatic and review of systems is unremarkable.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: The patient is a young Hispanic male, lying in bed, appear comfortable in no apparent distress.VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 97.8, heart rate 99, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 142/100, and saturation is 98% on room air.ENT: Sclerae nonicteric. Pupils reactive to light. Nostrils are normal. Oral cavity is clear.NECK: Supple. Trachea midline. No JVD.LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.HEART: Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs or gallops.ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended. Positive bowel sounds.EXTREMITIES: Pulses strong bilaterally. No edema.GENITAL: Testicles appear normal. The penis shaft has two lacerations on both sides, one of them is bleeding. They measure about 5 to 6 mm on the right side, about 3 or 4 mm on the left side. The one on the right side is bleeding much more than the other one. There is a marble that can be felt and it is freely mobile underneath the skin of the dorsum of the penis. There is no bleeding from the meatus or discharge and no other injuries were seen by inspection.LABORATORY DATA: White count 11.1, hemoglobin 14.5, hematocrit 43.5, and platelets 303,000. Coags unremarkable. Glucose 106, creatinine 0.8, sodium 141, potassium 4, and calcium 9.7. Urinalysis unremarkable.IMPRESSION: The patient with a penile laceration that is continuously bleeding from inserting a marble four days ago, which is still underneath the skin of the shaft of the penis. No other injuries that can be seen and no other evidence of secondary bacterial infection at this time. The patient is currently refusing removal of the marble and insisting on just repairing the laceration and he is having discussion with Dr. X.PLAN:1. The patient will be admitted to the hospital and will follow Dr. X's recommendation.2. The patient was offered a repair of those lacerations, to stop the bleeding as well as the removal of the marble and he is currently considering that and discussing that with Dr. X.3. Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection.4. He has mild hypertension, which is likely due to stress and pain and also the leukocytosis probably can be explained by that. This will be monitored.5. Monitor H&H to determine if he needs any transfusion at this time. He does not need that.6. IV fluid for hydration and volume resuscitation at this time.7. Pain management.8. Topical care for the wound VAC after repair.Time spent in evaluation and management of this patient including discussions about this procedure and the harm that can happen if he chooses to keep the penis including permanent damage and infection to the penis was 65 minutes.I had clearly explained to the patient in detail about the possibility of permanent penile damage that could affect erection and future sexual functioning as well as significant infection if a foreign object was retained in the penis under the skin and he verbalized understanding of this."
111,Urology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: ""Bloody bump on penis.""HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 29-year-old African-American male who presents to the Emergency Department today with complaint of a bleeding bump on his penis. The patient states that he has had a large bump on the end of his penis for approximately a year and a half. He states that it has never bled before. It has never caused him any pain or has never been itchy. The patient states that he is sexually active, but has been monogamous with the same person for the past 13 years. He states that he believes that his sexual partner is monogamous as well and reciprocates in this practice. The patient does state that last night he was ""trying to get some,"" meaning that he was engaging in sexual intercourse, at which time this bump bent backwards and ripped a portion of the skin on the tip of his penis. The patient said that there is a large amount of blood from this injury. This happened last night, but he was embarrassed to come to the Emergency Department yesterday when it was bleeding. The patient has been able to get the bleeding to stop, but the large bump is still located on the end of his penis, and he is concerned that it will rip off, and does want it removed. The patient denies any drainage or discharge from his penis. He denies fevers or chills recently. He also denies nausea or vomiting. The patient has not had any discharge from his penis. He has not had any other skin lesions on his penis that are new to him. He states that he has had numerous bumps along the head of his penis and on the shaft of his penis for many years. The patient has never had these checked out. He denies fevers, chills, or night sweats. He denies unintentional weight gain or loss. He denies any other bumps, rashes, or lesions throughout the skin on his body.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: No significant medical problems.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Surgery for excision of a bullet after being shot in the back.SOCIAL HABITS: The patient denies illicit drug usage. He occasionally smokes tobacco and drinks alcohol.MEDICATIONS: None.ALLERGIES: No known medical allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: This is an African-American male who appears his stated age of 29 years. He is well nourished, well developed, in no acute distress. The patient is pleasant. He is sitting on a Emergency Department gurney.VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure of 139/78, pulse of 83, respiratory rate of 18, and pulse oximetry of 98% on room air.HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. Clear S1, S2. No murmur, rub, or gallop is appreciated.LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended, and positive bowel sounds throughout.GENITOURINARY: The patient's external genitalia is markedly abnormal. There is a large pedunculated mass dangling from the glans of the penis at approximately the urethral meatus. This pedunculated mass is approximately 1.5 x 2 cm in size and pedunculated by a stalk that is approximately 2 mm in diameter. The patient appears to have condylomatous changes along the glans of the penis and on the shaft of the penis as well. There are no open lesions at this point. There is a small tear of the skin where the mass attaches to the glans near the urethral meatus. Bleeding is currently stanch, and there is no sign of secondary infection at this time. Bilateral testicles are descended and normal without pain or mass bilaterally. There is no inguinal adenopathy.EXTREMITIES: No edema.SKIN: Warm, dry, and intact. No rash or lesion.DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: Non-emergency department courses. It is thought that this patient should proceed directly with a referral to Urology for excision and biopsy of this mass.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Penile mass.

The patient verbalized understanding the plan of followup and is discharged in satisfactory condition from the ER."
112,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Nonfunctioning inflatable penile prosthesis.2. Peyronie's disease.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Nonfunctioning inflatable penile prosthesis.2. Peyronie's disease.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Ex-plantation of inflatable penile prosthesis and then placement of second inflatable penile prosthesis AMS700.ANESTHESIA: General LMA.SPECIMEN: Old triple component inflatable penile prosthesis.PROCEDURE: This is a 64-year-old male with prior history of Peyronie's disease and prior placement of a triple component inflatable penile prosthesis, which had worked for years for him, but has stopped working and subsequently has opted for ex-plantation and replacement of inflatable penile prosthesis.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: After informed consent, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position. General endotracheal intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Department and the perineum, scrotum, penis, and lower abdomen from the umbilicus down was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion in a 15-minute prep including iodine solution in the urethra. The bladder was subsequently drained with a red Robinson catheter. At that point, the patient was then draped in a sterile fashion and an infraumbilical midline incision was made and taken down through the subcutaneous space. Care was maintained to avoid all bleeding as possible secondary to the fact that we could not use Bovie cautery secondary to the patient's pacemaker and monopolar was only source of hemostasis besides suture. At that point, we got down to the fascia and the dorsal venous complex was easily identified as were both corporal bodies. Attention was taken then to the tubing, going up to the reservoir in the right lower quadrant. This was dissected out bluntly and sharply with Metzenbaum scissors and monopolar used for hemostasis. At this point, as we tracked this proximally to the area of the rectus muscle, we found that the tubing was violated and this was likely the source of his malfunctioned inflatable penile prosthesis. As we tried to remove the tubing and get to the reservoir, the tubing in fact completely broke as due to wire inside the tubing and the reservoir was left in its place secondary to risk of going after it and bleeding without the use of cautery. At that point, this tubing was then tracked down to the pump, which was fairly easily removed from the dartos pouch in the right scrotum. This was brought up into _________ incision and the two tubings going towards the two cylinders were subsequently tracked, first starting on the right side where a corporotomy incision was made at the placement of two #3-0 Prolene stay ties, staying lateral and anterior on the corporal body. The corporal body was opened up and the cylinder was removed from the right side without difficulty. However, we did have significant difficulty separating the tube connecting the pump to the right cylinder since this was surrounded by dense connective tissue and without the use of Bovie cautery, this was very difficult and was very time consuming, but we were able to do this and attention was then taken to the left side where the left proximal corporotomy was made after placement of two stick tie stay sutures. This was done anterior and lateral staying away from the neurovascular bundle in the midline and this was done proximally on the corporal body. The left cylinder was then subsequently explanted and this was very difficult as well trying to tract the tubing from the left cylinder across the midline back to the right pump since this was also densely scarred in and _________ a small amount of bleeding, which was controlled with monopolar and cautery was used on three different occasions, but just simple small burst under the guidance of anesthesia and there was no ectopy noted. After removal of half of the pump, all the tubing, and both cylinders, these were passed off the table as specimen. Both corporal bodies were then dilated with the Pratt dilators. These were already fairly well dilated secondary to explantation of our cylinders and antibiotic irrigation was copiously used at this point and irrigated out both of our corporal spaces. At this point, using the Farlow device, corporal bodies were measured first proximally then distally and they both measured out to be 9 cm proximally and 12 cm distally. He had an 18 cm with rear tips in place, which were removed. We decided to go ahead to and use another 18 cm inflatable penile prosthesis. Confident with our size, we then placed rear tips, originally 3 cm rear tips, however, we had difficulty placing the rear tips into the left crest. We felt that this was just a little bit too long and replaced both rear tips and down sized from 2 cm to 1 cm. At this point, we went ahead and placed the right cylinder using the Farlow device and the Keith needle, which was brought out through the glans penis and hemostated and the posterior rear tip was subsequently placed proximally, entered the crest without difficulty. Attention was then taken to the left side with the same thing was carried out, however, we did happen to dilate on two separate occasions both proximally and distally secondary to a very snug fit as well as buckling of the cylinders. This then forced us to down size to the 1 cm rear tips, which slipping very easily with the Farlow device through the glans penis. There was no crossover and no violation of the tunica albuginea. The rear tips were then placed without difficulty and our corporotomies were closed with #2-0 PDS in a running fashion. ________ starting on the patient's right side and then on the left side without difficulty and care was maintained to avoid damage or needle injury to the implants. At that point, the wound was copiously irrigated and the device was inflated multiple times. There was a very good fit and we had a very good result. At that point, the pump was subsequently placed in the dartos pouch, which already has been created and was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution. This was held in place with a Babcock as well not to migrate proximally and attention was then taken to our connection from the reservoir to the pump. Please also note that before placement of our pump, attention was then taken up to the left lower quadrant where an incision was then made in external oblique aponeurosis, approximately 3 cm dissection down underneath the rectus space was developed for our reservoir device, which was subsequently placed without difficulty and three simple interrupted sutures of #2-0 Vicryl used to close the defect in the rectus and at that point after placement of our pump, the connection was made between the pump and the reservoir without difficulty. The entire system pump and corporal bodies were subsequently flushed and all air bubbles were evacuated. After completion of the connection using a straight connector, the prosthesis was inflated and we had very good results with air inflation with good erection in both cylinders with a very slight deviation to the left, but this was able to be ________ with good cosmetic result. At that point, after irrigation again of the space, the area was simply dry and hemostatic. The soft tissue was reapproximated to separate the cylinder so as not to lie in rope against one another and the wound was closed in multiple layers. The soft tissue and the skin was then reapproximated with staples. Please also note that prior to the skin closure, a Jackson-Pratt drain was subsequently placed through the left skin and left lower quadrant and subsequently placed just over tubings, would be left in place for approximately 12 to 20 hours. This was also sutured in place with nylon. Sterile dressing was applied. Light gauze was wrapped around the penis and/or sutures that begin at the tip of the glans penis were subsequently cut and removed in entirety bilaterally. Coban was used then to wrap the penis and at the end of the case the patient was straight catheted, approximately 400 cc of amber-yellow urine. No Foley catheter was used or placed.The patient was awoken in the operative suite, extubated, and transferred to recovery room in stable condition. He will be admitted overnight to the service of Dr. McDevitt. Cardiology will be asked to consult with Dr. Stomel for a pacer placement and he will be placed on the Telemetry floor and kept on IV antibiotics."
113,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Penile skin bridges after circumcision.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Penile skin bridges after circumcision.PROCEDURE: Excision of penile skin bridges about 2 cm in size.ABNORMAL FINDINGS: Same as above.ANESTHESIA: General inhalation anesthetic with caudal block.FLUIDS RECEIVED: 300 mL of crystalloids.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL.SPECIMENS: No tissue sent to Pathology.TUBES AND DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used.COUNT: Sponge and needle counts were correct x2.INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 2-1/2-year-old boy with a history of newborn circumcision who developed multiple skin bridges after circumcision causing curvature with erection. Plan is for repair.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient is taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and the patient's identification was verified. Once he was anesthetized, the caudal block was placed and IV antibiotics were given. He was then placed in a supine position and sterilely prepped and draped. Once he was prepped and draped, we used a straight mosquito clamp and went under the bridges and crushed them, and then excised them with a curved iris and curved tenotomy scissors. We removed the excessive skin on the shaft skin and on the glans itself. We then on the ventrum excised the bridge and did a Heinecke-Mikulicz closure with interrupted figure-of-eight and interrupted suture of 5-0 chromic. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis. Once this was done, we then used Dermabond tissue adhesive and Surgicel to prevent the bridges from returning again. IV Toradol was given at the end of procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well, was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room."

120,Urology,"PROSTATE BRACHYTHERAPY - PROSTATE I-125 IMPLANTATIONThis patient will be treated to the prostate with ultrasound-guided I-125 seed implantation. The original consultation and treatment planning will be separately performed. At the time of the implantation, special coordination will be required. Stepping ultrasound will be performed and utilized in the pre-planning process. Some discrepancies are frequently identified, based on the positioning, edema, and/or change in the tumor since the pre-planning process. Re-assessment is required at the time of surgery, evaluating the pre-plan and comparing to the stepping ultrasound. Modifications will be made in real time to add or subtract needles and seeds as required. This may be integrated with the loading of the seeds performed by the brachytherapist, as well as coordinated with the urologist, dosimetrist or physicist.The brachytherapy must be customized to fit the individual's tumor and prostate. Attention is given both preoperatively and intraoperatively to avoid overdosage of rectum and bladder."
121,Urology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient returns for followup evaluation 21 months after undergoing prostate fossa irradiation for recurrent Gleason 8 adenocarcinoma. His urinary function had been stable until 2 days ago. Over the past couple of days he has been waking every 1 to 1-1/2 hours and has had associated abdominal cramping, as well as a bit of sore throat (his wife has had a cold for about 2 weeks). His libido remains intact (but he has not been sexually functional), but his erections have been dysfunctional. The bowel function is stable with occasional irritative hemorrhoidal symptoms. He has had no hematochezia. The PSA has been slowly rising in recent months. This month it reached 1.2.PAIN ASSESSMENT: Abdominal cramping in the past 2 days. No more than 1 to 2 of 10 in intensity.PERFORMANCE STATUS: Karnofsky score 100.

122,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer, Gleason score 4+3 with 85% burden and 8/12 cores positive.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer, Gleason score 4+3 with 85% burden and 8/12 cores positive.PROCEDURE DONE: Open radical retropubic prostatectomy with bilateral lymph node dissection.INDICATIONS: This is a 66-year-old gentleman who had an elevated PSA of 5. His previous PSAs were in the 1 range. TRUS biopsy revealed 4+3 Gleason score prostate cancer with a large tumor burden. After extensive counseling, the patient elected for retropubic radical prostatectomy. Given his disease burden, it was advised that an open prostatectomy is probably the standard of care to ensure entire excision. The patient consented and agreed to proceed forward.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room here. Time out was taken to properly identify the patient and procedure going to be done. General anesthesia was induced. The patient was placed in the supine position. The bed was flexed distant to the pubic area. The patient's lower abdominal area, pubic area, and penile and scrotal area were clipped, and then scrubbed with Hibiclens soap for three minutes. The patient was then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion. Foley catheter was inserted sterilely in the field. Preoperative antibiotics were given within 30 minutes of skin incision. A 10 cm lower abdominal incision was made from the symphysis pubis towards the umbilicus. Dissection was taken down through Scarpa's fascia to the level of the anterior rectus sheath. The rectus sheath was then incised and the muscle was split in the middle. Space of rectus sheath was then entered. The Bookwalter ring was then applied to the belly, and the bladder was then retracted to the right side, thus exposing the left obturator area. The lymph node packet on the left side was then dissected. This was done in a split and roll fashion with the flimsy tissue, and the left external iliac vein was incised, and the tissues were then rolled over the left external iliac vein. Dissection was carried down from the left external iliac vein to the obturator nerve and up to the level of the pelvic sidewall. The proximal extent of dissection was the left hypogastric artery to the level of the node of Cloquet distally. Care was taken to avoid injury to the nerves. An accessory obturator vein was noted and was ligated. The same procedure was done on the right side with dissection of the right obturator lymph node packet, which was sent for pathologic evaluation. The bladder subsequently was retracted cephalad. The prostate was then defatted up to the level of the endopelvic fascia. The endopelvic fascia was then incised bilaterally, and the incision was then taken to the level of the puboprostatic ligaments. Vicryl stitch was then applied at the level of the bladder neck in order to control the bladder back bleeders. A Babcock was then applied around the dorsal venous complex over the urethra and the K-wire was then passed between the dorsal vein complex and the urethra by passing by the aid of a right angle. A 0-Vicryl stitch was then applied over the dorsal venous complex, which was then tied down and cinched to the symphysis pubis. Using a knife on a long handle, the dorsal venous complex was then incised using the K-wire as a guide. Following the incision of the dorsal venous complex, the anterior urethra was then incised, thus exposing the Foley catheter. The 3-0 Monocryl sutures were then applied going outside in on the anterior aspect of the urethra. The lateral edges of the urethra were also then incised, and two lateral stitches were also applied going outside end. The catheter was then drawn back at the level of membranous urethra, and a final posterior stitch was applied going outside end. The urethra was subsequently divided in its entirety. A Foley catheter was then taken out and was inserted directly into the bladder through the prostatic apex. The prostate was then entered cephalad, and the prostatic pedicles were then systematically taken down with the right angle clips and cut. Please note that throughout the case, the patient was noted to have significant oozing and bleeding partially from the dorsal venous complex, pelvic veins, and extensive vascularity that was noted in the patient's pelvic fatty tissue. Throughout the case, the bleeding was controlled with the aid of a clips, Vicryl sutures, silk sutures, and ties, direct pressure packing, and FloSeal. Following the excision of the prostatic pedicles, the posterior dissection at this point was almost complete. Please note that the dissection was relatively technically challenging due to extensive adhesions between the prostate and Denonvilliers' fascia. The seminal vesicle on the left side was dissected in its entirety; however, the seminal vesicle on the right side was adherently stuck to the Denonvilliers' fascia, which prompted the excision of most of the right seminal vesicle with the exception of the tip. Care was taken throughout the posterior dissection to preserve the integrity of the ureters. The anterior bladder neck was then cut anteriorly, and the bladder neck was separated from the prostate. Following the dissection, the 5-French feeding tubes were inserted bilaterally into the ureters thus insuring their integrity. Following the dissection of the bladder from the prostate, the prostate at this point was mobile and was sent for pathological evaluation. The bladder neck was then repaired using Vicryl in a tennis racquet fashion. The rest of the mucosa was then everted. The ureteral orifices and ureters were protected throughout the procedure. At this point, the initial sutures that were applied into the urethra were then applied into the corresponding position on the bladder neck, and the bladder neck was then cinched down and tied down after a new Foley catheter was inserted through the penile meatus and into the bladder pulling the bladder in position. Hemostasis was then adequately obtained. FloSeal was applied to the pelvis. The bladder was then irrigated. It was draining pink urine. The wound was copiously irrigated. The fascia was then closed using a #1 looped PDS. The skin wound was then irrigated, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion. At this point, the procedure was terminated with no complications. The patient was then extubated in the operating room and taken in stable condition to the PACU. Please note that during the case about 3600 mL of blood was noted. This was due to the persistent continuous oozing from vascular fatty tissue and pelvic veins as previously noted in the dictation."
123,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer.OPERATION PERFORMED: Radical retropubic nerve-sparing prostatectomy without lymph node dissection.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 450 mL.REPLACEMENT: 250 mL of Cell Saver and crystalloid.COMPLICATIONS: None.INDICATIONS OF SURGERY: This is a 67-year-old man with needle biopsy proven to be Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma in one solitary place on the right side of the prostate. Due to him being healthy with no comorbid conditions, he has elected to undergo surgical treatment with radical retropubic prostatectomy. Potential complications include, but are not limited to:1. Infection.2. Bleeding.3. Incontinence.4. Impotence.5. Injury to the adjacent viscera.6. Deep venous thrombosis.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room. Epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by Dr. A without any difficulty. The patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique. A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained. A midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade. The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the Bovie. Transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly. A Bookwalter retractor was then placed. The area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected. Given this patient's low Gleason score and low PSA with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy. The endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the Metzenbaum scissors. Opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection. Small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device. The dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures. The deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using Allis also and ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion. With the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the Bovie. Deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors. The urethra could then be easily identified. Nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using Metzenbaum scissors. This exposed the blue Foley catheter. Anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 Monocryl suture. Six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly. The Foley catheter was then removed. This allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally. Lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally. This effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate. Continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat. The prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat. The floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate. Maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved. The prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps. The prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only. Absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time. The dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized. The prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side. The bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method. Unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy. Once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles. This was developed without any difficulty. Both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected. The seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis. About two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed. The tip was left behind. Using the bipolar Gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected. This was performed on the left side and then the right side. This completely freed the prostate. The prostate was sent for permanent section. The opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures. Small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature. The ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures. The previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck. This was performed by using a French ***** needle. A 20-French Foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down. A 15 mL of sterile water was inflated to balloon. The bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty. A 19-French Blake Drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region. All instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure. The rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS. Subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."

He has elected to undergo radical retropubic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection. Potential complications include, but are not limited to:1. Infection.2. Bleeding.3. Incontinence.4. Impotence.5. Deep venous thrombosis.6. Recurrence of the cancer.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Epidural anesthesia was administered by the anesthesiologist in the holding area. Preoperative antibiotic was also given in the preoperative holding area. The patient was then taken into the operating room after which general LMA anesthesia was administered. The patient was shaved and then prepped using Betadine solution. A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder with clear urine drain. A midline infraumbilical incision was performed. The rectus fascia was opened sharply. The perivesical space and the retropubic space were developed bluntly. Bookwalter retractor was then placed. Bilateral obturator pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. The obturator nerve was identified and was untouched. The margin for the resection of the lymph node bilaterally were the Cooper's ligament, the medial edge of the external iliac artery, the bifurcation of the common iliac vein, the obturator nerve, and the bladder. Both hemostasis and lymphostasis was achieved by using silk ties and Hemo clips. The lymph nodes were palpably normal and were set for permanent section. The Bookwalter retractor was then repositioned and the endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally using Metzenbaum scissors. The puboprostatic ligament was taken down sharply. The superficial dorsal vein complex over the prostate was bunched up by using the Allis clamp and then tied by using 2-0 silk sutures. The deep dorsal vein complex was then bunched up by using the Allis over the membranous urethral area. The dorsal vein complex was ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture on a CT-1 needle. The Allis clamp was removed and the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors. The urethra was then identified and was dissected out. The urethral opening was made just distal to the apex of the prostate by using Metzenbaum scissors. This was extended circumferentially until the Foley catheter could be seen clearly. 2-0 Monocryl sutures were then placed on the urethral stump evenly spaced out for the anastomosis to be performed later. The Foley catheter was removed and the posteriormost aspect of urethra and rectourethralis muscle was transected. The lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally to sweep the neurovascular bundles laterally on both sides. The plane between Denonvilliers' fascia and the perirectal fat was developed sharply. No tension was placed on the neurovascular bundle at any point in time. The prostate dissected off the rectal wall easily. Once the seminal vesicles were identified, the fascia covering over them were opened transversely. The seminal vesicles were dissected out and the small bleeding vessels leading to them were clipped by using medium clips and then transected. The bladder neck was then dissected out carefully to spare most of the bladder neck muscles. Once all of the prostate had been dissected off the bladder neck circumferentially the mucosa lining the bladder neck was transected releasing the entire specimen. The specimen was inspected and appeared to be completely intact. It was sent for permanent section. The bladder neck mucosa was then everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures. Inspection at the prostatic bed revealed no bleeding vessels. The sutures, which were placed previously onto the urethral stump, were then placed onto the bladder neck. Once the posterior sutures had been placed, the Foley was placed into the urethra and into the bladder neck. A 20-French Foley Catheter was used. The anterior sutures were then placed. The Foley was then inflated. The bed was straightened and the sutures were tied down sequentially from anteriorly to posteriorly. Mild traction of the Foley catheter was placed to assure the anastomosis was tight. Two #19-French Blake drains were placed in the perivesical spaces. These were anchored to the skin by using 2-0 silk sutures. The instrument counts, lab counts, and sponge counts were verified to be correct, the patient was closed. The fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS. Subcutaneous tissue was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture. Skin was approximated by using metallic clips. The patient tolerated the operation well."

Bladder suspension.ANESTHESIA: General by intubation.The patient understands his diagnosis, grade, stage and prognosis. He understands this procedure, options to it and potential benefits from it. He strongly wishes to proceed. He accepts all treatment-associated risks to include but not be limited to bleeding requiring transfusion; infection; sepsis; heart attack; stroke; bladder neck contractures; need to convert to an open procedure; urinary fistulae; impotence; incontinence; injury to bowel/rectum/bladder/ureters, etc.; small-bowel obstruction; abdominal hernia; osteitis pubis/chronic pelvic pain, etc.DESCRIPTION OF THE CASE: The patient was taken to the operating room, given a successful general anesthetic, placed in the lithotomy position, prepped with Betadine solutions and draped in the usual sterile fashion. My camera ports were then placed in the standard fan array. A camera port was placed in the midline above the umbilicus using the Hasson technique. The balloon port was placed, the abdomen insufflated, and all other ports were placed under direct vision. My assistant was on the right. The patient was then placed in the steep Trendelenburg position, and the robot brought forward and appropriately docked.I then proceeded to drop the bladder into the peritoneal cavity by incising between the right and left medial umbilical ligaments and carrying that dissection laterally along these ligaments deep into the pelvis. This nicely exposed the space of Retzius. I then defatted the anterior surface of the prostate and endopelvic fascia.The endopelvic fascia was then opened bilaterally. The levator ani muscles were carefully dissected free from the prostate and pushed laterally. Dissection was continued posteriorly toward the bundles and caudally to the apex. The puboprostatic ligaments were then transected. A secure ligature of 0 Vicryl was placed around the dorsal venous complex.I then approached the bladder neck. The anterior bladder neck was transected down to the level of the Foley catheter, which was lifted anteriorly in the wound. I then transected the posterior bladder neck down to the level of the ampullae of the vas. The ampullae were mobilized and transected. These were lifted anteriorly in the field, exposing the seminal vesicles, which were similarly mobilized. Hemostasis was obtained using the bipolar Bovie.I then identified the Denonvilliers fascia, and this was incised sharply. Dissection was continued caudally along the anterior surface of the rectum and laterally toward the bundles. I was able to then identify the pedicles over the seminal vesicles, which were hemoclipped and transected.The field was then copiously irrigated with sterile water. Hemostasis was found to be complete. I then carried out a urethrovesical anastomosis. This was accomplished with 3-0 Monocryl ligatures. Two of these were tied together in the midline. They were placed at the 6 o'clock position, and one was run in a clockwise and the other in a counterclockwise direction to the 12 o'clock position where they were securely tied. A new Foley catheter was then easily delivered into the bladder and irrigated without extravasation. The patient was given indigo carmine, and there was prompt blue urine in the Foley.I then carried out a bladder suspension. This was done in hopes of obtaining early urinary control. This was accomplished with 0 Vicryl ligatures. One was placed at the bladder neck and through the dorsal venous complex and then the other along the anterior surface of the bladder to the posterior surface of the pubis. This nicely re-retroperitonealized the bladder.The prostate was then placed in an Endocatch bag and brought out through an extended camera port incision. A JP drain was brought in through the 4th arm port and sutured to the skin with 2-0 silk. The camera port fascia was closed with running 0 Vicryl. The skin incisions were closed with a running, subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl.The patient tolerated the procedure very well. There were no complications. Sponge and instrument counts were reported correct at the end of the case."

128,Urology,"PROCEDURES:1. Robotic-assisted pyeloplasty.2. Anterograde right ureteral stent placement.3. Transposition of anterior crossing vessels on the right.4. Nephrolithotomy.DIAGNOSIS: Right ureteropelvic junction obstruction.DRAINS:1. Jackson-Pratt drain times one from the right flank.2. Foley catheter times one.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 30 cc.COMPLICATIONS: None.SPECIMENS:1. Renal pelvis.2. Kidney stones.INDICATIONS: The patient is a 30-year-old Caucasian gentleman with history of hematuria subsequently found to have right renal stones and patulous right collecting system with notable two right crossing renal arteries. Up on consideration of various modalities and therapy, the patient decided to undergo surgical therapy.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was verified by armband and the procedure being robotic-assisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy was verified, and the procedure was carried out. After institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotics, the patient was positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated. Great care was taken to pad all pressure points and a right arm hanger was used. The patient was flexed slightly, and a kidney rest was used. Sequential compression devices were also placed. Next, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidone-iodine. Pneumoperitoneum was obtained by placing a Veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test. A low pressure, high flow pneumoperitoneum was adequately obtained using CO2 gas. Next, a 12-mm camera port was placed near the umbilicus. The camera was inserted, and no bowel injury was seen. Next, under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera ports, a 12 mm assist port, a 5 mm liver retraction port, and 5 mm assist port were placed. The robot was docked and the instruments passed through respective checks. Initial attention was directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially. Next, the right lateral duodenum was cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum. At this point, the right kidney was in clear view, and the fascia was entered. Initial attention was directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which was done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection. It became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessels one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole. These arteries were dissected carefully and vessel loops were applied. Next, a small hole was then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the contents of the renal pelvis were suctioned out. The pyelotomy was extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected. Sequentially, each major calyx was inspected under direct vision and irrigated. A total of four round kidney stones were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient. At this point, we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which was dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis. The proximal ureter was spatulated using cold scissors. Next, redundant renal pelvis was excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section. We then identified the most inferior/dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteral-renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion. 3-0 Monocryl sutures were used to re-anastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis. Next, remainder of the pyelotomy was closed to itself also using 2-0 Monocryl sutures. Before final stitches were placed, a 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde. This was accomplished by placing the stents over a guidewire, placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter. This was done until the proximal end was in the renal pelvis, the guidewire was removed, and good proximal curl was verified by direct vision. Then, the pyelotomy was completely closed again with 2-0 Monocryl sutures. Next, attention was directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with Vicryl suture that would impinge less upon the renal pelvis. Good pulsation was verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy sutures. Next, Gerota's fascia was reapproximated and closed with Vicryl sutures as was the right peritoneum. Hemostasis appeared excellent at this point. There was no obvious urine extravasation. At this time, the procedure was terminated. The robot was undocked. Under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm ports were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 Vicryl sutures in an interrupted fashion. Then, all skin port sites were closed with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and Dermabond and band-aids were applied over this. Also, notably a Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision. The patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication was noted.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to Post Anesthesia Care Unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to begin his recovery."
129,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Left obstructed renal ureteropelvic junction obstruction status post pyeloplasty, percutaneous procedure, and pyeloureteroscopy x2, and status post Pseudomonas pyelonephritis x6, renal insufficiency, and solitary kidney.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Left obstructed renal ureteropelvic junction obstruction status post pyeloplasty, percutaneous procedure, and pyeloureteroscopy x2, and status post Pseudomonas pyelonephritis x6, renal insufficiency, and solitary kidney.PROCEDURE: Cystoscopy under anesthesia, retrograde and antegrade pyeloureteroscopy, left ureteropelvic junction obstruction, difficult and open renal biopsy.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthetic with a caudal block x2.FLUIDS RECEIVED: 1000 mL crystalloid.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL.SPECIMENS: Tissue sent to pathology is a renal biopsy.ABNORMAL FINDINGS: A stenotic scarred ureteropelvic junction with dilated ureter and dilated renal pelvis.TUBES AND DRAINS: A 10-French silicone Foley catheter with 3 mL in balloon and a 4.7-French ureteral double J-stent multilength.INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 3-1/2-year-old boy, who has a solitary left kidney with renal insufficiency with creatinine of 1.2, who has had a ureteropelvic junction repair performed by Dr. Chang. It was subsequently obstructed with multiple episodes of pyelonephritis, two percutaneous tube placements, ureteroscopy with balloon dilation of the system, and continued obstruction. Plan is for co surgeons due to the complexity of the situation and the solitary kidney to do surgical procedure to correct the obstruction.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operative room. Surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Dr. X and Dr. Y both agreed upon the procedures in advance. Dr. Y then, once the patient was anesthetized, requested IV antibiotics with Fortaz, the patient had a caudal block placed, and he was then placed in lithotomy position. Dr. Y then calibrated the urethra with the bougie a boule to 8, 10, and up to 12 French. The 9.5-French cystoscope sheath was then placed within the patient's bladder with the offset scope, and his bladder had no evidence of cystitis. I was able to locate the ureteral orifice bilaterally, although no urine coming from the right. We then placed a 4-French ureteral catheter into the ureter as far as we could go. An antegrade nephrostogram was then performed, which shows that the contrast filled the dilated pelvis, but did not go into the ureter. A retrograde was performed, and it was found that there was a narrowed band across the two. Upon draining the ureter allowing to drain to gravity, the pelvis which had been clamped and its nephrostomy tube did not drain at all. Dr. Y then placed a 0.035 guidewire into the ureter after removing the 4-French catheter and then placed a 4.7-French double-J catheter into the ureter as far as it would go allowing it to coil in the bladder. Once this was completed, we then removed the cystoscope and sheath, placed a 10-French Foley catheter, and the patient was positioned by Dr. X and Dr. Y into the flank position with the left flank up after adequate padding on the arms and legs as well as a brachial plexus roll. He was then sterilely prepped and draped. Dr. Y then incised the skin with a 15-blade knife through the old incision and then extended the incision with curved mosquito clamp and Dr. X performed cautery of the areas advanced to be excised. Once this was then dissected, Dr. Y and Dr. X divided the lumbosacral fascia; at the latissimus dorsi fascia, posterior dorsal lumbotomy maneuver using the electrocautery; and then using curved mosquito clamps __________. At this point, Dr. X used the cautery to enter the posterior retroperitoneal space through the posterior abdominal fascia. Dr. Y then used the curved right angle clamp and dissected around towards the ureter, which was markedly adherent to the base of the retroperitoneum. Dr. X and Dr. Y also needed dissection on the medial and lateral aspects with Dr. Y being on the lateral aspect of the area and Dr. X on the medial to get an adequate length of this. The tissue was markedly inflamed and had significant adhesions noted. The patient's spermatic vessels were also in the region as well as the renal vessels markedly scarred close to the ureteropelvic junction. Ultimately, Dr. Y and Dr. X both with alternating dissection were able to dissect the renal pelvis to a position where Dr. Y put stay sutures and a 4-0 chromic to isolate the four quadrant area where we replaced the ureter. Dr. X then divided the ureter and suture ligated the base, which was obstructed with a 3-0 chromic suture. Dr. Y then spatulated the ureter for about 1.5 cm, and the stent was gently delivered in a normal location out of the ureter at the proximal and left alone in the bladder. Dr. Y then incised the renal pelvis and dissected and opened it enough to allow the new ureteropelvic junction repair to be performed. Dr. Y then placed interrupted sutures of 5-0 Monocryl at the apex to repair the most dependent portion of the renal pelvis, entered the lateral aspect, interrupted sutures of the repair. Dr. X then was able to without much difficulty do interrupted sutures on the medial aspect. The stent was then placed into the bladder in the proper orientation and alternating sutures by Dr. Y and Dr. X closed the ureteropelvic junction without any evidence of leakage. Once this was complete, we removed the extra stay stitches and watched the ureter lay back into the retroperitoneum in a normal position without any kinking in apparently good position. This opening was at least 1.5 cm wide. Dr. Y then placed 2 stay sutures of 2-0 chromic in the lower pole of the kidney and then incised wedge biopsy and excised the biopsy with a 15-blade knife and curved iris scissors for renal biopsy for determination of renal tissue health. Electrocautery was used on the base. There was no bleeding, however, and the tissue was quite soft. Dermabond and Gelfoam were placed, and then Dr. Y closed the biopsy site over with thrombin-Gelfoam using the 2-0 chromic stay sutures. Dr. X then closed the fascial layers with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl in 3 layers. Dr. Y closed the Scarpa fascia and the skin with 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Rapide respectively. A 4-0 nylon suture was then placed by Dr. Y around the previous nephrostomy tube, which was again left clamped. Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed over the incision and then a dry sterile dressing was placed by Dr. Y over the nephrostomy tube site, which was left clamped, and the patient then had a Foley catheter placed in the bladder. The Foley catheter was then taped to his leg. A second caudal block was placed for anesthesia, and he is in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room."

Right double-J stent placement 22 x 4.5 mm.FIRST SECOND ANESTHESIA: General.SPECIMEN: Urine for culture and sensitivity.DRAINS: 22 x 4.5 mm right double-J ureteral stent.PROCEDURE: After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to operating room and placed in the supine position. She was given general anesthesia and then placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through the urethra into the bladder. There was noted to be some tightness of the urethra on passage. On visualization of the bladder, there were no stones or any other debris within the bladder. There were no abnormalities seen. No masses, diverticuli, or other abnormal findings. Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and attempts to pass to a cone tip catheter, however, the ureteral orifice was noted to be also tight and we were unable to pass the cone tip catheter. The cone tip catheter was removed and a glidewire was then passed without difficulty up into the renal pelvis. An open-end ureteral catheter was then passed ________ into the distal right ureter. Retrograde pyelogram was then performed.There was noted to be an UPJ calculus with no noted hydronephrosis. The wire was then passed back through the ureteral catheter. The catheter was removed and a 22 x 4.5 mm double-J ureteral stent was then passed over the glidewire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance. The stent was clear within the kidney as well as within the bladder. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. She will be discharged home. She is to follow up with Dr. X for ESWL procedure. She will be given prescription for Darvocet and will be asked to have a KUB x-ray done prior to her followup and to bring them with her to her appointment."

Status post radical retropubic prostatectomy and subsequent salvage radiation therapy.TITLE OF OPERATION: Salvage cystectomy (very difficult due to postradical prostatectomy and postradiation therapy to the pelvis), Indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion, and omental pedicle flap to the pelvis.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal with epidural.INDICATIONS: This patient is a 65-year-old white male who in 1998 had a radical prostatectomy. He was initially dry without pads and then underwent salvage radiation therapy for rising PSA. After that he began with episodes of incontinence as well as urinary retention requiring catheterization. One year ago, he was unable to catheterize and was taken to the operative room and had cystoscopy. He had retained staple removed and a diverticulum identified. There were also bladder stones that were lasered and removed, and he had been incontinent ever since that time. He wears 8 to 10 pads per day, and this has affected his quality of life significantly. I took him to the operating room on January 16, 2008, and found diffuse radiation changes with a small capacity bladder and wide-open bladder neck. We both felt that his lower urinary tract was not rehabilitatable and that a continent cutaneous diversion would solve the number of problems facing him. I felt like if we could remove the bladder safely, then this would also provide a benefit.FINDINGS: At exploration, there were no gross lesions of the smaller or large bowel. The bladder was predictably sucked into the pelvic sidewall both inferiorly and laterally. The opened bladder, which we were able to remove completely, had a wide-open capacious diverticulum in its very distal segment. Because of the previous radiation therapy and a dissection down to the pelvis, I elected to place an omental pedicle flap to provide additional blood supply for healing as well in the pelvis and also under the pubic bone which was exposed inferiorly due to previous surgery and treatment.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, placed in the supine position, flexed over the anterosuperior iliac spine, and his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A nasogastric tube was placed as well as radial arterial line. He was given intravenous antibiotics for prophylaxis. A generous midline skin incision was made from the midepigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deep into the rectus fascia, the rectus muscle separated in the midline, and exploration carried out with the findings described. Moist wound towels and a Bookwalter retractor were placed for exposure. We began by retracting the bowels by mobilizing the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure and elevating the terminal ileum up to the second and third portion of the duodenum. The ureter was identified as a crisis over the iliac vessels and dissected deep into pelvis and subsequently divided between clips. An identical procedure was performed in the left side with similar findings and the bowels were packed cephalad.We began then dissecting the bladder away from the pelvic side walls staying medial to both epigastric arteries. This was quite challenging because of the previous radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy. We essentially carved the bladder off of the pelvic sidewall inferiorly as best we could and then we were able to have enough freedom to identify the lateral pedicles, and these were taken between double clips approximately and clipped distally. We then approached things posteriorly and carefully dissected between the __________ and posterior bladder. There was some remnant seminal vesicle on the right as well as both remnant ejaculatory duct and we used this to dissect the longus safe plane anterior to the rectum. We then entered the bladder anteriorly as distal as we could and remove the bladder and what we thought was a bladder neck and this appeared to end in a diverticulum. We then peeled it off the remaining rectum and passed the specimen off the operative field. Bladder was irrigated with warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection was made for hemostasis.We then completely mobilized the omentum off of the proximal transverse colon. This allowed a generous flap to be able to be laid into the pelvis without tension.We then turned our attention to forming the Indiana pouch. I completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon. The colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a GIA-80 stapler. I then divided the avascular plane of Treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum. The mesentery was then sealed with a LigaSure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a GIA-60 stapler. We then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a GIA-80 stapler, closing the open end with a TA 60. The angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures.We then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-French Robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the GIA-60 stapler. The ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by Rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-French Robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic ""pop,"" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve.As the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy. We then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 Vicryl sutures. The bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the SGIA Polysorb-75. Between the staple lines, Vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture ligatures.We then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis. The left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a Cook 8.4-French ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture. The right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis. We then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture. A 24-French Malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture. The staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 Vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a TA 60 Polysorb suture. The pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact.We then made a final inspection for hemostasis. The cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures. We then matured our stoma through the umbilicus. We removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this. A portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures. We left an 18-French Robinson through the stomag and secured this to the skin with silk sutures. The Malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion.We matured the stoma to the umbilicus with interrupted chromic stitches. The stitch was brought out to the right upper quadrant and the Malecot to the left lower quadrant. A Large JP drain was placed in the pelvis dependent to the omentum pedicle flap as well as the Indiana pouch.The rectus fascia was closed with a buried #2 Prolene running stitch, tying a new figure-of-eight proximally and distally and meeting in the middle and tying it underneath the fascia. Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and skin was closed with surgical clips. The estimated blood loss was 450 mL, and the patient received no packed red blood cells. The final sponge and needle count were reported to be correct. The patient was awakened and extubated, and taken on stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."

Already, de-torsed bilateral testes fixation and bilateral appendix testes cautery.ANESTHETIC: A 0.25% Marcaine local wound insufflation per surgeon, 15 mL of Toradol.FINDINGS: Congestion in the left testis and cord with a bell-clapper deformity on the right small appendix testes bilaterally. No testis necrosis.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 5 mL.FLUIDS RECEIVED: 300 mL of crystalloid.TUBES AND DRAINS: None.SPECIMENS: No tissues sent to pathology.COUNTS: Sponges and needle counts were correct x2.INDICATIONS OF OPERATION: The patient is a 4-year-old boy with abrupt onset of left testicular pain. He has had a history of similar onset. Apparently, he had no full on one ultrasound and full on a second ultrasound, but because of possible torsion, detorsion, or incomplete detorsion, I recommended an exploration.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification was verified. Once he was anesthetized, he was placed in supine position and sterilely prepped and draped. Superior scrotal incisions were then made with 15-blade knife and further extended up to the subcutaneous tissue and dartos fascia with electrocautery. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis. The subdartos pouch was created with curved tenotomy scissors. The tunica vaginalis was then delivered, incised, and testis was delivered. The testis itself with a bell-clapper deformity. There was no actual torsion at the present time, there was some modest congestion and, however, the vasculature was markedly congested down the cord. The penis fascia was cauterized and subdartos pouch was created. The upper aspect of fascia was then closed with pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic. The testis was then placed into the scrotum in a proper orientation. No tacking sutures within the testis itself were used. The tunica vaginalis; however, was wrapped perfectly behind the back of the testis. A similar procedure was performed on the right side. Again, an appendix testis was cauterized. No torsion was seen. He also had a bell-clapper deformity and similar dartos pouch was created and the testis was placed in the scrotum in the proper orientation and the upper aspect closed with #4-0 chromic suture. The local anesthetic was then used for both as cord block, as well as a local wound insufflation bilaterally with 0.25% Marcaine. The scrotal wall was then closed with subcuticular closure of #4-0 chromic. Dermabond tissue adhesive was then used. The patient tolerated the procedure well. He was given IV Toradol and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition."

Intraoperatively, the bladder appeared normal with the exception of some minor trabeculations. The ureteral orifices were normal bilaterally.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: This patient was brought to the operating room, a general anesthetic was administered. She was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. Her vulva, vagina, and perineum were prepped with Betadine scrubbed in solution. She was draped in usual sterile fashion. A Sims retractor was placed into the vagina and Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder. Two Allis clamps were placed over the mid urethra. This area was injected with 0.50% lidocaine containing 1:200,000 epinephrine solution. Two areas suprapubically on either side of midline were injected with the same anesthetic solution. The stab wound incisions were made in these locations and a sagittal incision was made over the mid urethra. Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect bilaterally to the level of the ischial pubic ramus. The SPARC needles were then placed through the suprapubic incisions and then directed through the vaginal incision bilaterally. The Foley catheter was removed. A cystoscopy was performed using a 70-degree cystoscope. There was noted to be no violation of the bladder. The SPARC mesh was then snapped onto the needles, which were withdrawn through the stab wound incisions. The mesh was snugged up against a Mayo scissor held under the mid urethra. The overlying plastic sheaths were removed. The mesh was cut below the surface of the skin. The skin was closed with 4-0 Plain suture. The vaginal vault was closed with a running 2-0 Vicryl stitch. The blood loss was minimal. The patient was awoken and she was brought to recovery in stable condition."
134,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right spermatocele.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right spermatocele.OPERATIONS PERFORMED:1. Right spermatocelectomy.2. Right orchidopexy.ANESTHESIA: Local MAC.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.FLUIDS: Crystalloid.BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PATIENT: The patient is a 77-year-old male who comes to the office with a large right spermatocele. The patient says it does bother him on and off, has occasional pain and discomfort with it, has difficulty with putting clothes on etc. and wanted to remove. Options such as watchful waiting, removal of the spermatocele or needle drainage were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, risk of infection, scrotal pain, and testicular pain were discussed. The patient was told that his scrotum may enlarge in the postoperative period for about a month and it will settle down. The patient was told about the risk of recurrence of spermatocele. The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options and wanted to proceed with removal.DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient's scrotal area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A midline scrotal incision was made measuring about 2 cm in size. The incision was carried through the dartos through the scrotal sac and the spermatocele was identified. All the layers of the spermatocele were removed. Clear layer was visualized, was taken all the way up to the base, the base was tied. Entire spermatocele sac was removed. After removing the entire spermatocele sac, hemostasis was obtained. The testicle was not in normal orientation. The testis and epididymis was removed, which is a small appendage on the superior aspect of the testicle. The testicle was placed in a normal orientation. Careful attention was drawn not to twist the cord. Orchidopexy was done to allow the testes to stay stable in the postoperative period using 4-0 Vicryl and was tied at 3 different locations. Absorbable sutures were used, so that the patient does not feel the sutures in the postoperative period. The dartos was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in running locking fashion. There was excellent hemostasis. The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was brought to the recovery room in stable condition."

The patient also has family status complete and desired infertility. The patient was scheduled for elective left spermatocelectomy and bilateral partial vasectomy.FINDINGS: At this time of the surgery, significant left-sided spermatocele was noted encompassing almost the entirety of the left epididymis with only minimal amount of normal appearing epididymis remaining.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was moved to the operating room. A general anesthesia was induced by the Department of Anesthesia.The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion for a scrotal approach. A #15 blade was used to make a transverse incision on the left hemiscrotum. Electrocautery was used to carry the incision down into the tunica vaginalis and the testicle was delivered into the field. The left testicle was examined. A large spermatocele was noted. Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect the tissue around the left spermatocele. Once the spermatocele was identified, as stated above, significant size was noted encompassing the entire left epididymis. Metzenbaum scissors as well as electrocautery was used to dissect free the spermatocele from its testicular attachments and spermatocelectomy and left epididymectomy was completed with electrocautery. Electrocautery was used to confirm excellent hemostasis. Attention was then turned to the more proximal aspect of the cord. The vas deferens was palpated and dissected free with Metzenbaum scissors. Hemostats were placed on the two aspects of the cord, approximately 1 cm segment of cord was removed with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery was used to cauterize the lumen of the both ends of vas deferens and silk ties used to ligate the cut ends. Testicle was placed back in the scrotum in appropriate anatomic position. The dartos tissue was closed with running #3-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed in a horizontal interrupted mattress fashion with #4-0 chromic. Attention was then turned to the right side. The vas was palpated in the scrotum. A small skin incision was made with a #15 blade and the vas was grasped with a small Allis clamp and brought into the surgical field. A scalpel was used to excise the vas sheath and vas was freed from its attachments and grasped again with a hemostat. Two ends were hemostated with hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors. Lumen was coagulated with electrocautery. Silk ties used to ligate both cut ends of the vas deferens and placed back into the scrotum. A #4-0 chromic suture was used in simple fashion to reapproximate the skin incision. Scrotum was cleaned and bacitracin ointment, sterile dressing, fluffs, and supportive briefs applied. The patient was sent to Recovery in stable condition. He was given prescriptions for doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d., for five days and Vicodin ES 1 p.o. q.4h. p.r.n., pain, #30 for pain. The patient is to followup with Dr. X in seven days."
136,Urology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Testicular pain.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 4-year-old boy with a history of abrupt onset of left testicular pain at 11:30 this morning. He was unable to walk and would not stand upright, and had fairly significant discomfort, so the parents checked his panel because of it. Because of this, they took him to Emergency Department, at which time, he had no swelling noted initially, but very painful. He had no voiding or stooling problems. No nausea, vomiting or fever. Family denies trauma or dysuria. At that time, he was going to get an ultrasound done, but the mother said that all of sudden the patient stated the pain had resolved. He has had hot chocolate this morning at 10:30 in the morning and water around 2:30 in the morning. He has not had any pain since but states that he has had pain in the past, not as long and states there was a twisting sensation. He has no recent cold or flu, although he had rhinorrhea about 3 weeks ago. He is on no medications and he is here for evaluation.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has no known allergies. He is term delivery via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He has had no problems or hospitalizations with circumcision.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He has had no previous surgeries.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: All 14-point review of systems were negative except for the above left testicular pain and the history of possible upper respiratory infection about 2 to 3 weeks ago.IMMUNIZATIONS: Up-to-date.FAMILY HISTORY: The patient lives at home with both parents who are Spanish speaking. He is not in school.MEDICATIONS: He is on no medications.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: On physical exam, weight is 15.9 kg.GENERAL: The patient is a cooperative little boy.HEENT: Normal head and neck exam. No oral or nasal discharge.NECK: Without masses.CHEST: Without masses.LUNGS: Clear.CARDIAC: Without murmurs or gallops.ABDOMEN: Soft. No masses or tenderness. His scrotum did not have any swelling at the present time. There was only minimal discomfort with palpation at the left inguinal area, but no masses were noted. No palpable nodules such as appendix testis and no swelling was noted and he had mild epididymal swelling only. His left testis was slightly harder than the right, but this was not very significant.EXTREMITIES: He had full range of motion in all 4 extremities.SKIN: Warm, pink, and dry.NEUROLOGIC: Grossly intact.LABORATORY DATA: Ultrasound was obtained today showing no blood flow or poor blood flow on the left except for increased blood flow to the epididymis on the study done at about 1330 hours, and second one done around 1630 hours was normal flow, possible increased flow on the left. This is personally reviewed by me. The right was normal. No masses were appreciated. There was some mild change in echotexture on the left on the initial study, which had apparently resolved on the second, but may be due to the technical aspects of the study.ASSESSMENT/PLAN: The patient has a possibly torsion detorsion versus other acute testicular problem. If the patient has indeed testicular torsion, there is an increased possibility that it may reoccur again, actually within the first 24 to 36 hours and as such is recommended doing a left scrotal exploration with possible detorsion of left testis, possible orchiectomy if the testis is markedly abnormal or nonviable, which probably is not the case, and bilateral testes fixation if the torsion is found. I discussed the pre and postsurgical care with the parents. Procedure itself with potential complications, risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery including that the torsion could occur again, although it is less likely after the surgical fixation procedure. The parents understand and wished to proceed. We will schedule this later today emergently."

138,Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bladder tumor.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bladder tumor.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Transurethral resection of a medium bladder tumor (TURBT), left lateral wall.ANESTHESIA: Spinal.SPECIMEN TO PATHOLOGY: Bladder tumor and specimen from base of bladder tumor.DRAINS: A 22-French 3-way Foley catheter, 30 mL balloon.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 74-year-old male who presented with microscopic and an episode of gross hematuria. He underwent an IVP, which demonstrated enlarged prostate and normal upper tracts. Cystoscopy in the office demonstrated a 2.5- to 3-cm left lateral wall bladder tumor. He is brought to the operating room for transurethral resection of that bladder tumor.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: After preoperative counseling of the patient and his wife, the patient was taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthetic. He was placed in lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Using the visual obturator, the resectoscope was then inserted per urethra into the bladder. The bladder was inspected confirming previous cystoscopic findings of a 2.5- to 3-cm left lateral wall bladder tumor away from the ureteral orifice. Using the resectoscope loop, the tumor was then resected down to its base in a stepwise fashion. Following completion of resection down to the base, the bladder was _______ free of tumor specimen. The resectoscope was then reinserted and the base of the bladder tumor was then resected to get the base of the bladder tumor specimen, this was sent as a separate pathological specimen. Hemostasis was assured with electrocautery. The base of the tumor was then fulgurated again and into the periphery out in the normal mucosa surrounding the base of the bladder tumor. Following completion of the fulguration, there was good hemostasis. The remainder of the bladder was without evidence of significant abnormality. Both ureteral orifices were visualized and noted to drain freely of clear urine. The bladder was filled and the resectoscope was removed. A 22-French 3-way Foley catheter was inserted per urethra into the bladder. The balloon was inflated to 30 mL. The catheter with sterile continuous irrigation and was noted to drain clear irrigant. The patient was then removed from lithotomy position. He was in stable condition."

He was found to have a new tumor last fall, and cystoscopy in November showed Ta papillary-appearing lesion inside the bladder neck anteriorly. The patient had coronary artery disease and required revascularization, which occurred at the end of December prior to the tumor resection. He is fully recovered and cleared by Cardiology and taken to the operating room at this time for TURBT.FINDINGS: Cystoscopy of the anterior and posterior urethra was within normal limits. From 12 o'clock to 4 o'clock inside the bladder neck, there was a papillary tumor with some associated blood clot. This was completely resected. There was an abnormal dysplastic area in the left lateral wall that was biopsied, and the remainder of the bladder mucosa appeared normal. The ureteral orifices were in the orthotopic location. Prostate was 15 g and benign on rectal examination, and there was no induration of the bladder.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the cystoscopy suite, and after adequate general laryngeal mask anesthesia obtained, placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and his perineum and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion. He had been given oral ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis. Rectal bimanual examination was performed with the findings described. Cystourethroscopy was performed with a #23-French ACMI panendoscope and 70-degree lens with the findings described. A barbotage urine was obtained for cytology. The cystoscope was removed and a #24-French continuous flow resectoscope sheath was introduced over visual obturator and cold cup biopsy forceps introduced. Several biopsies were taken from the tumor and sent to the tumor bank. I then introduced the Iglesias resectoscope element and resected all the exophytic tumor and the lamina propria. Because of the Ta appearance, I did not intentionally dissect deeper into the muscle. Complete hemostasis was obtained. All the chips were removed with an Ellik evacuator. Using the cold cup biopsy forceps, biopsy was taken from the dysplastic area in the left bladder and hemostasis achieved. The irrigant was clear. At the conclusion of the procedure, the resectoscope was removed and a #24-French Foley catheter was placed for efflux of clear irrigant. The patient was then returned to the supine position, awakened, extubated, and taken on a stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."

The patient was stabilized from cardiac standpoint on a renal ultrasound. The patient was found to have a bladder mass. The patient does have a history of bladder cancer. Options were watchful waiting, resection of the bladder tumor were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE were discussed. The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options and wanted to proceed with the procedure.DETAILS OF THE OR: The patient was brought to the OR, anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 23-French scope was inserted inside the urethra into the bladder. The entire bladder was visualized, which appeared to have a large tumor, lateral to the right ureteral opening.There was a significant papillary superficial fluffiness around the left ________. There was a periureteral diverticulum, lateral to the left ureteral opening. There were moderate trabeculations throughout the bladder. There were no stones. Using a French cone tip catheter, bilateral pyelograms were obtained, which appeared normal. Subsequently, using 24-French cutting loop resectoscope a resection of the bladder tumor was performed all the way up to the base. Deep biopsies were sent separately. Coagulation was performed around the periphery and at the base of the tumor. All the tumors were removed and sent for path analysis. There was an excellent hemostasis. The rest of the bladder appeared normal. There was no further evidence of tumor. At the end of the procedure, a 22 three-way catheter was placed, and the patient was brought to the recovery in a stable condition."

He has had problem with urinary retention and bladder stones in the past. He will need to have transurethral resection of prostate to alleviate the above-mentioned problems. Potential complications include, but are not limited to:1. Infection.2. Bleeding.3. Incontinence.4. Impotence.5. Formation of urethral strictures.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was identified, after which he was taken into the operating room. General LMA anesthesia was then administered. The patient was given prophylactic antibiotic in the preoperative holding area. The patient was then positioned, prepped and draped. Cystoscopy was then performed by using a #26-French continuous flow resectoscopic sheath and a visual obturator. The prostatic urethra appeared to be moderately hypertrophied due to the lateral lobes and a large median lobe. The anterior urethra was normal without strictures or lesions. The bladder was severely trabeculated with multiple bladder diverticula. There is a very bladder diverticula located in the right posterior bladder wall just proximal to the trigone. Using the ***** resection apparatus and a right angle resection loop, the prostate was resected initially at the area of the median lobe. Once the median lobe has completely resected, the left lateral lobe and then the right lateral lobes were taken down. Once an adequate channel had been achieved, the prostatic specimen was retrieved from the bladder by using an Ellik evacuator. A 3-mm bar electrode was then introduced into the prostate to achieve perfect hemostasis. The sheath was then removed under direct vision and a #24-French Foley catheter was then inserted atraumatically with pinkish irrigation fluid obtained. The patient tolerated the operation well."

151,Urology,"Sample Doctor, M.D.Sample AddressRE: Sample PatientWife's name: Sample NameDear Sample Doctor:Mr. Sample Patient was seen on Month DD, YYYY, describing a vasectomy 10 years ago and a failed vasectomy reversal done almost two years ago at the University of Michigan. He has remained azoospermic postoperatively. The operative note suggests the presence of some sperm and sperm head on the right side at the time of the vasectomy reversal.He states that he is interested in sperm harvesting and cryopreservation prior to the next attempted ovulation induction for his wife. Apparently, several attempts at induction have been tried and due to some anatomic abnormality, they have been unsuccessful.At the time that he left the office, he was asking for cryopreservation. At the time of sperm harvesting, I recently received a phone call suggesting that he does not want to do this at all unless his wife's ovulation has been confirmed and it appears then that he may be interested in a fresh specimen harvest. I look forward to hearing from you regarding the actual plan so that we can arrange our procedure appropriately. At his initial request, Month DD, YYYY was picked as the date for scheduled harvesting, although this may change if you require fresh specimen.Thank you very much for the opportunity to have seen him.Sample Doctor, M.D."
