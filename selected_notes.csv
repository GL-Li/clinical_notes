Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal wall abscess.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal wall abscess.PROCEDURE: Incision and drainage (I&D) of abdominal abscess, excisional debridement of nonviable and viable skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle, then removal of foreign body.ANESTHESIA: LMA.INDICATIONS: Patient is a pleasant 60-year-old gentleman, who initially had a sigmoid colectomy for diverticular abscess, subsequently had a dehiscence with evisceration. Came in approximately 36 hours ago with pain across his lower abdomen. CT scan demonstrated presence of an abscess beneath the incision. I recommended to the patient he undergo the above-named procedure. Procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, alternatives forms of therapy were discussed with him, and he was agreeable to surgery.FINDINGS: The patient was found to have an abscess that went down to the level of the fascia. The anterior layer of the fascia was fibrinous and some portions necrotic. This was excisionally debrided using the Bovie cautery, and there were multiple pieces of suture within the wound and these were removed as well.TECHNIQUE: Patient was identified, then taken into the operating room, where after induction of appropriate anesthesia, his abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in a sterile fashion. The wound opening where it was draining was explored using a curette. The extent of the wound marked with a marking pen and using the Bovie cautery, the abscess was opened and drained. I then noted that there was a significant amount of undermining. These margins were marked with a marking pen, excised with Bovie cautery; the curette was used to remove the necrotic fascia. The wound was irrigated; cultures sent prior to irrigation and after achievement of excellent hemostasis, the wound was packed with antibiotic-soaked gauze. A dressing was applied. The finished wound size was 9.0 x 5.3 x 5.2 cm in size. Patient tolerated the procedure well. Dressing was applied, and he was taken to recovery room in stable condition."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Congenital chylous ascites and chylothorax.2. Rule out infradiaphragmatic lymphatic leak.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Diffuse intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia.ANESTHESIA: General.INDICATION: The patient is an unfortunate 6-month-old baby boy, who has been hospitalized most of his life with recurrent chylothoraces and chylous ascites. The patient has been treated somewhat successfully with TPN and voluntary restriction of enteral nutrition, but he had repeated chylothoraces. Last week, Dr. X took the patient to the operating room in hopes that with thoracotomy, a thoracic duct leak could be found, which would be successfully closed surgically. However at the time of his thoracotomy exploration what was discovered was a large amount of transdiaphragmatic transition of chylous ascites coming from the abdomen. Dr. X opened the diaphragm and could literally see a fountain of chylous fluid exiting through the diaphragmatic hole. This was closed, and we decided that perhaps an abdominal exploration as a last stage effort would allow us to find an area of lymphatic leak that could potentially help the patient from this dismal prognostic disease. We met with his parents and talked to them about this, and he is here today for that attempt.OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient's abdomen was relatively soft, minimally distended. Exploration through supraumbilical transverse incision immediately revealed a large amount of chylous ascites upon entering into the peritoneal cavity. What we found which explains the chronic chylous ascites and chylothorax was a diffuse lymphangiectatic picture involving the small bowel mesentery approximately two thirds to three quarters of the distal small bowel including all of the ileum, the cecum, and the portion of the ascending colon. It appeared that any attempt to resect this area would have been met with failure because of the extensive lymphatic dilatation all the way down towards the root of the supramesenteric artery. There was about one quarter to one third of the jejunum that did not appear to be grossly involved, but I did not think that resection of three quarters of the patient's small bowel would be viable surgical option. Instead, we opted to close his abdomen and refer for potential small intestine transplantation procedure in the future if he is a candidate for that.The lymphatic abnormality was extensive. They were linear dilated lymphatic channels on the serosal surface of the bowel in the mesentery. They were small aneurysm-like pockets of chyle all along the course of the mesenteric structures and in the mesentery medially adjacent to the bowel as well. No other major retroperitoneal structure or correctable structure was identified. Both indirect inguinal hernias were wide open and could be palpated from an internal aspect as well.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was brought from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit to the operating room within an endotracheal tube im place and with enteral feeds established at full flow to provide maximum fat content and maximum lymphatic flow. We conducted a surgical time-out and reiterated all of the patient's important identifying information and confirmed the operative plan as described above. Preparation and draping of his abdomen was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then we opened his peritoneal cavity through a transverse supraumbilical incision dividing both rectus muscles and all layers of the abdominal wall fascia. As the peritoneal cavity was entered, we divided the umbilical vein ligamentum teres remnant between Vicryl ties, and we were able to readily identify a large amount of chylous ascites that had been previously described. The bowel was eviscerated, and then with careful inspection, we were able to identify this extensive area of intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia that was a source of the patient's chylous ascites. The small bowel from the ligament of Treitz to the proximal to mid jejunum was largely unaffected, but did not appear that resection of 75% of the small intestine and colon would be a satisfactory tradeoff for The patient, but would likely render him with significant short bowel and nutritional and metabolic problems. Furthermore, it might burn bridges necessary for consideration of intestinal transplantation in the future if that becomes an option. We suctioned free all of the chylous accumulations, replaced the intestines to their peritoneal cavity, and then closed the patient's abdominal incision with 4-0 PDS on the posterior sheath and 3-0 PDS on the anterior rectus sheath. Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for skin closure.The patient tolerated the procedure well. He lost minimal blood, but did lose approximately 100 mL of chylous fluid from the abdomen that was suctioned free as part of the chylous ascitic leak. The patient was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with his endotracheal tube in place and to consider the next stage of management, which might be an attempted additional type of feeding or referral to an Intestinal Transplantation Center to see if that is an option for the patient because he has no universally satisfactory medical or surgical treatment for this at this time."
Gastroenterology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Abdominal pain.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 71-year-old female patient of Dr. X. The patient presented to the emergency room last evening with approximately 7- to 8-day history of abdominal pain which has been persistent. She was seen 3 to 4 days ago at ABC ER and underwent evaluation and discharged and had a CT scan at that time and she was told it was """"normal."""" She was given oral antibiotics of Cipro and Flagyl. She has had no nausea and vomiting, but has had persistent associated anorexia. She is passing flatus, but had some obstipation symptoms with the last bowel movement two days ago. She denies any bright red blood per rectum and no history of recent melena. Her last colonoscopy was approximately 5 years ago with Dr. Y. She has had no definite fevers or chills and no history of jaundice. The patient denies any significant recent weight loss.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for history of atrial fibrillation, under good control and now in normal sinus rhythm and on metoprolol and also on Premarin hormone replacement.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and hysterectomy. She has a long history of known grade 4 bladder prolapse and she has been seen in the past by Dr. Chip Winkel, I believe that he has not been re-consulted.ALLERGIES: SHE IS ALLERGIC OR SENSITIVE TO MACRODANTIN.SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not drink or smoke.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise negative for any recent febrile illnesses, chest pains or shortness of breath.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: The patient is an elderly thin white female, very pleasant, in no acute distress.VITAL SIGNS: Her temperature is 98.8 and vital signs are all stable, within normal limits.HEENT: Head is grossly atraumatic and normocephalic. Sclerae are anicteric. The conjunctivae are non-injected.NECK: Supple.CHEST: Clear.HEART: Regular rate and rhythm.ABDOMEN: Generally nondistended and soft. She is focally tender in the left lower quadrant to deep palpation with a palpable fullness or mass and focally tender, but no rebound tenderness. There is no CVA or flank tenderness, although some very minimal left flank tenderness.PELVIC: Currently deferred, but has history of grade 4 urinary bladder prolapse.EXTREMITIES: Grossly and neurovascularly intact.LABORATORY VALUES: White blood cell count is 5.3, hemoglobin 12.8, and platelet count normal. Alkaline phosphatase elevated at 184. Liver function tests otherwise normal. Electrolytes normal. Glucose 134, BUN 4, and creatinine 0.7.DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.IMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 71-year-old female with greater than one-week history of abdominal pain now more localized to the left lower quadrant. Currently is a nonacute abdomen. The working diagnosis would be sigmoid diverticulitis. She does have a history in the distant past of sigmoid diverticulitis. I would recommend a repeat stat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and keep the patient nothing by mouth. The patient was seen 5 years ago by Dr. Y in Colorectal Surgery. We will consult her also for evaluation. The patient will need repeat colonoscopy in the near future and be kept nothing by mouth now empirically. The case was discussed with the patient's primary care physician, Dr. X. Again, currently there is no indication for acute surgical intervention on today's date, although the patient will need close observation and further diagnostic workup."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent re-infected sebaceous cyst of abdomen.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Abscess secondary to retained foreign body.2. Incisional hernia.PROCEDURES1. Excision of abscess, removal of foreign body.2. Repair of incisional hernia.ANESTHESIA: LMA.INDICATIONS: Patient is a pleasant 37-year-old gentleman who has had multiple procedures including a laparotomy related to trauma. The patient has had a recurrently infected cyst of his mass at the superior aspect of his incision, which he says gets larger and then it drains internally, causing him to be quite ill. He presented to my office and I recommended that he undergo exploration of this area and removal. The procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, and alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable to surgery.FINDINGS: The patient was found upon excision of the cyst that it contained a large Prolene suture, which is multiply knotted as it always is; beneath this was a very small incisional hernia, the hernia cavity, which contained omentum; the hernia was easily repaired.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was identified, then taken into the operating room, where after induction of an LMA anesthetic, his abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in sterile fashion. The puncta of the wound lesion was infiltrated with methylene blue and peroxide. The lesion was excised and the existing scar was excised using an ellipse and using a tenotomy scissors, the cyst was excised down to its base. In doing so, we identified a large Prolene suture within the wound and followed this cyst down to its base at which time we found that it contained omentum and was in fact overlying a small incisional hernia. The cyst was removed in its entirety, divided from the omentum using a Metzenbaum and tying with 2-0 silk ties. The hernia repair was undertaken with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture with simple sutures. The wound was then irrigated and closed with 3-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular and Steri-Strips. Patient tolerated the procedure well. Dressings were applied and he was taken to recovery room in stable condition."
Gastroenterology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Nausea.PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 28-year-old, who is status post gastric bypass surgery nearly one year ago. He has lost about 200 pounds and was otherwise doing well until yesterday evening around 7:00-8:00 when he developed nausea and right upper quadrant pain, which apparently wrapped around toward his right side and back. He feels like he was on it but has not done so. He has overall malaise and a low-grade temperature of 100.3. He denies any prior similar or lesser symptoms. His last normal bowel movement was yesterday. He denies any outright chills or blood per rectum.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension and morbid obesity, now resolved.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Gastric bypass surgery in December 2007.MEDICATIONS: Multivitamins and calcium.ALLERGIES: None known.FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for diabetes mellitus in his father, who is now deceased.SOCIAL HISTORY: He denies tobacco or alcohol. He has what sounds like a data entry computer job.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise negative.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His temperature is 100.3, blood pressure 129/59, respirations 16, heart rate 84. He is drowsy, but easily arousable and appropriate with conversation. He is oriented to person, place, and situation. He is normocephalic, atraumatic. His sclerae are anicteric. His mucous membranes are somewhat tacky. His neck is supple and symmetric. His respirations are unlabored and clear. He has a regular rate and rhythm. His abdomen is soft. He has diffuse right upper quadrant tenderness, worse focally, but no rebound or guarding. He otherwise has no organomegaly, masses, or abdominal hernias evident. His extremities are symmetrical with no edema. His posterior tibial pulses are palpable and symmetric. He is grossly nonfocal neurologically.STUDIES: His white blood cell count is 8.4 with 79 segs.

His AST 349, ALT 186, alk-phos 138 and lipase is normal at 239.ASSESSMENT: Choledocholithiasis, ? cholecystitis.PLAN: He will be admitted and placed on IV antibiotics. We will get an ultrasound this morning. He will need his gallbladder out, probably with intraoperative cholangiogram. Hopefully, the stone will pass this way. Due to his anatomy, an ERCP would prove quite difficult if not impossible unless laparoscopic assisted. Dr. X will see him later this morning and discuss the plan further. The patient understands."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES1. Adrenal mass, right sided.2. Umbilical hernia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES1. Adrenal mass, right sided.2. Umbilical hernia.OPERATION PERFORMED: Laparoscopic hand-assisted left adrenalectomy and umbilical hernia repair.ANESTHESIA: General.CLINICAL NOTE: This is a 52-year-old inmate with a 5.5 cm diameter nonfunctioning mass in his right adrenal. Procedure was explained including risks of infection, bleeding, possibility of transfusion, possibility of further treatments being required. Alternative of fully laparoscopic are open surgery or watching the lesion.DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: In the right flank-up position, table was flexed. He had a Foley catheter in place. Incision was made from just above the umbilicus, about 5.5 cm in diameter. The umbilical hernia was taken down. An 11 mm trocar was placed in the midline, superior to the GelPort and a 5 mm trocar placed in the midaxillary line below the costal margin. A liver retractor was placed to this.The colon was reflected medially by incising the white line of Toldt. The liver attachments to the adrenal kidney were divided and the liver was reflected superiorly. The vena cava was identified. The main renal vein was identified. Coming superior to the main renal vein, staying right on the vena cava, all small vessels were clipped and then divided. Coming along the superior pole of the kidney, the tumor was dissected free from top of the kidney with clips and Bovie. The harmonic scalpel was utilized superiorly and laterally. Posterior attachments were divided between clips and once the whole adrenal was mobilized, the adrenal vein and one large adrenal artery were noted, doubly clipped, and divided. Specimen was placed in a collection bag, removed intact.Hemostasis was excellent.The umbilical hernia had been completely taken down. The edges were freshened up. Vicryl #1 was utilized to close the incision and 2-0 Vicryl was used to close the fascia of the trocar.Skin closed with clips.He tolerated the procedure well. All sponge and instrument counts were correct. Estimated blood loss less than 100 mL.The patient was awakened, extubated, and returned to recovery room in satisfactory condition."
Gastroenterology,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Possible free air under the diaphragm.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 77-year-old female who is unable to give any information. She has been sedated with Ativan and came into the emergency room obtunded and unable to give any history. On a chest x-ray for what appeared to be shortness of breath she was found to have what was thought to be free air under the right diaphragm.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for alcohol abuse. Unable to really gather any other information because she is so obtunded.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Looking at the medical chart, she had an appendectomy, right hip fracture from a fall in 2005, and TAH/BSO.MEDICATIONS: Unable to evaluate.ALLERGIES: UNABLE TO EVALUATE.SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant history of alcohol abuse, according to the emergency room physician, who sees her on a regular basis.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unable to obtain.PHYSICAL EXAMVITAL SIGNS: Temp 98.3, heart rate 82, respiratory rate 24, and blood pressure 141/70.GENERAL: She is a very obtunded female who upon arousal is not able to provide any information of any use.HEENT: Atraumatic.NECK: Soft and supple.LUNGS: Bilaterally diminished.HEART: Regular.ABDOMEN: Soft, and with deep palpation I am unable to arouse the patient, unable to elicit any tenderness.LABORATORY STUDIES: Show a normal white blood cell count with no shift. Elevated AST at 138, with a normal ALT at 38. Alkaline phosphatase of 96, bilirubin 0.8. Sodium is 107, with 68 chloride and potassium of 2.8.X-ray of the chest shows the possibility of free air; therefore, a CT scan was obtained because of the patient's physical examination, which shows no evidence of intra-abdominal pathology. The etiology of the air under the diaphragm is actually a colonic air that is anterior superior to the dome of the diaphragm, near the dome of the liver.ASSESSMENT: No intra-abdominal pathology.PLAN: Have her admitted to the medical service for treatment of her hyponatremia."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Appendicitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Appendicitis, nonperforated.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Appendectomy.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.A transverse right lower quadrant incision was made directly over the point of maximal tenderness. Sharp dissection utilizing Bovie electrocautery was used to expose the external oblique fascia. The fascia of the external oblique was incised in the direction of the fibers, and the muscle was spread with a clamp. The internal oblique fascia was similarly incised and its muscular fibers were similarly spread. The transversus abdominis muscle, transversalis fascia and peritoneum were incised sharply gaining entrance into the abdominal cavity without incident. Upon entering the peritoneal cavity, the peritoneal fluid was noted to be clean.The cecum was then grasped along the taenia with a moist gauze sponge and was gently mobilized into the wound. After the appendix was fully visualized, the mesentery was divided between Kelly clamps and ligated with 2-0 Vicryl ties. The base of the appendix was crushed with a clamp and then the clamp was reapplied proximally on the appendix. The base was ligated with 2-0 Vicryl tie over the crushed area, and the appendix amputated along the clamp. The stump of the appendix was cauterized and the cecum was returned to the abdomen.The peritoneum was irrigated with warm sterile saline. The mesoappendix and cecum were examined for hemostasis which was present. The wound was closed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl for the peritoneum and 0 Vicryl for the internal oblique and external oblique layers. The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. A dressing was placed on the wound. All surgical counts were reported as correct.Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis, gangrenous.PROCEDURE: Appendectomy.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room under urgent conditions. After having obtained an informed consent, he was placed in the operating room and under anesthesia. Followed by a time-out process, his abdominal wall was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Antibiotics had been given prior to incision. A McBurney incision was performed and it carried out through the peritoneal cavity. Immediately there was purulent material seen in the area. Samples were taken for culture and sensitivity of aerobic and anaerobic sets. The appendix was markedly swollen particularly in its distal three-fourth, where the distal appendix showed an abscess formation and devitalization of the wall. There was quite a bit of local peritonitis. The mesoappendix was clamped, divided and ligated, and then the appendix was ligated and divided, and the stump buried with a pursestring suture of Vicryl and then a Z stitch. The area was abundantly irrigated with normal saline and also the pelvis. The distal foot of small bowel had been explored and because it delivered itself __________ the incision and showed no pathology.Then the peritoneal and internal fascia were approximated with a suture of 0 Vicryl and then the incision was closed in layers and after each layer the wound was irrigated with normal saline. The skin was closed with a combination of a subcuticular suture of fine Monocryl followed by the application of Dermabond. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Estimated blood loss was minimal, and the patient was sent to the recovery room for recovery in satisfactory condition."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Pelvic inflammatory disease.2. Periappendicitis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:1. Laparoscopic appendectomy.2. Peritoneal toilet and photos.ANESTHESIA: General.COMPLICATIONS: None.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 cc.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 31-year-old African-American female who presented with right lower quadrant abdominal pain presented with acute appendicitis. She also had mild leukocytosis with bright blood cell count of 12,000. The necessity for diagnostic laparoscopy was explained and possible appendectomy. The patient is agreeable to proceed and signed preoperatively informed consent.PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia by Anesthesia Department.The preoperative Foley, antibiotics, and NG tube are placed for decompression and the anterior abdominal wall was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and infraumbilical incision is performed with a #10 blade scalpel with anterior and superior traction on the abdominal wall. A Veress needle was introduced and 15 mm pneumoperitoneum is created with CO2 insufflation. At this point, the Veress needle was removed and a 10 mm trocar is introduced intraperitoneally. A second 5 mm port was introduced in the right upper quadrant under direct visualization and blunted graspers were introduced to bring the appendix into view. With the aid of a laparoscope, the pelvis was visualized. The ovaries are brought in views and photos are taken. There is evidence of a purulence in the cul-de-sac and ________ with a right ovarian hemorrhagic cyst. Attention was then turned on the right lower quadrant. The retrocecal appendix is freed with peritoneal adhesions removed with Endoshears. Attention was turned to the suprapubic area. The 12 mm port was introduced under direct visualization and the mesoappendix was identified. A 45 mm endovascular stapling device was fired across the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix sequentially with no evidence of bleeding or leakage from the staple line. Next, ________ tube was used to obtain Gram stain and cultures of the pelvic fluid and a pelvic toilet was performed with copious irrigation of sterile saline. Next, attention was turned to the right upper quadrant. There is evidence of adhesions from the liver surface to the anterior abdominal wall consistent with Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome also a prior pelvic inflammatory disease. All free fluid is aspirated and patient's all port sites are removed under direct visualization and the appendix is submitted to pathology for final pathology. Once the ports are removed the pneumoperitoneum is allowed to escape for patient's postoperative comfort and two larger port sites at the suprapubic and infraumbilical sites are closed with #0 Vicryl suture on a UR-6 needle. Local anesthetic is infiltrated at L3 port sites for postoperative analgesia and #4-0 Vicryl subcuticular closure is performed with undyed Vicryl. Steri-Strips are applied along with sterile dressings. The patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and transferred to recovery room with postoperative broad-spectrum IV antibiotics in the General Medical Floor. Routine postoperative care will be continued on this patient."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis.PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic appendectomy.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.INDICATIONS: Patient is a pleasant 31-year-old gentleman who presented to the hospital with acute onset of right lower quadrant pain. History as well as signs and symptoms are consistent with acute appendicitis as was his CAT scan. I evaluated the patient in the emergency room and recommended that he undergo the above-named procedure. The procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable with surgery.FINDINGS: Patient was found to have acute appendicitis with an inflamed appendix, which was edematous, but essentially no suppuration.TECHNIQUE: The patient was identified and then taken into the operating room, where after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in sterile fashion. An infraumbilical incision was made and carried down by blunt dissection to the level of the fascia, which was grasped with an Allis clamp and two stay sutures of 2-0 Vicryl were placed on either side of the midline. The fascia was tented and incised and the peritoneum entered by blunt finger dissection. A Hasson cannula was placed and a pneumoperitoneum to 15 mmHg pressure was obtained. Patient was placed in the Trendelenburg position, rotated to his left, whereupon under direct vision, the 12-mm midline as well as 5-mm midclavicular and anterior axillary ports were placed. The appendix was easily visualized, grasped with a Babcock's. A window was created in the mesoappendix between the appendix and the cecum and the Endo GIA was introduced and the appendix was amputated from the base of the cecum. The mesoappendix was divided using the Endo GIA with vascular staples. The appendix was placed within an Endo bag and delivered from the abdominal cavity. The intra-abdominal cavity was irrigated. Hemostasis was assured within the mesentery and at the base of the cecum. All ports were removed under direct vision and then wounds were irrigated with saline antibiotic solution. The infraumbilical defect was closed with a figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl suture. The remaining wounds were irrigated and then everything was closed subcuticular with 4-0 Vicryl suture and Steri-Strips. Patient tolerated the procedure well, dressings were applied, and he was taken to recovery room in stable condition."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute suppurative appendicitis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic appendectomy.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal and Marcaine 0.25% local.INDICATIONS: This 29-year-old female presents to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Department on 08/30/2003 with history of acute abdominal pain. On evaluation, it was noted that the patient has clinical findings consistent with acute appendicitis. However, the patient with additional history of loose stools for several days prior to event. Therefore, a CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained revealing findings consistent with acute appendicitis. There was no evidence of colitis on the CAT scan. With this in mind and the patient's continued pain at present, the patient was explained the risks and benefits of appendectomy. She agreed to procedure and informed consent was obtained.GROSS FINDINGS: The appendix was removed without difficulty with laparoscopic approach. The appendix itself noted to have a significant inflammation about it. There was no evidence of perforation of the appendix.PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient was placed in supine position. After appropriate anesthesia was obtained and sterile prep and drape completed, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make a curvilinear infraumbilical incision. Through this incision, a Veress needle was utilized to create a CO2 pneumoperitoneum of 15 mmHg. The Veress needle was then removed. A 10 mm trocar was then introduced through this incision into the abdomen. A video laparoscope was then inserted and the above noted gross findings were appreciated upon evaluation. Initially, bilateral ovarian cysts were appreciated, however, there was no evidence of acute disease on evaluation. Photodocumentation was obtained.A 5 mm port was then placed in the right upper quadrant. This was done under direct visualization and a blunt grasper was utilized to mobilize the appendix. Next, a 12 mm port was placed in the left lower quadrant lateral to the rectus musculature under direct visualization. Through this port, the dissector was utilized to create a small window in the mesoappendix. Next, an EndoGIA with GI staples was utilized to fire across the base of the appendix, which was done noting it to be at the base of the appendix. Next, staples were changed to vascular staples and the mesoappendix was then cut and vessels were then ligated with vascular staples. Two 6 X-loupe wires with EndoGIA were utilized in this prior portion of the procedure. Next, an EndoCatch was placed through the 12 mm port and the appendix was placed within it. The appendix was then removed from the 12 mm port site and taken off the surgical site. The 12 mm port was then placed back into the abdomen and CO2 pneumoperitoneum was recreated. The base of the appendix was reevaluated and noted to be hemostatic. Aspiration of warm saline irrigant then done and noted to be clear. There was a small adhesion appreciated in the region of the surgical site. This was taken down with blunt dissection without difficulty. There was no evidence of other areas of disease. Upon re-exploration with a video laparoscope in the abdomen and after this noting the appendix base to be hemostatic and intact. The instruments were removed from the patient and the port sites were then taken off under direct visualization. The CO2 pneumoperitoneum was released into the air and the fascia was approximated in the 10 mm and 12 mm port sites with #0 Vicryl ligature x2. Marcaine 0.25% was then utilized in all three incision sites and #4-0 Vicryl suture was used to approximate the skin and all three incision sites. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and taken to Postoperative Care Unit in stable condition and monitored under General Medical Floor on IV antibiotics, pain medications, and return to diet."
Gastroenterology,"EXAM: Barium enema.CLINICAL HISTORY: A 4-year-old male with a history of encopresis and constipation.TECHNIQUE: A single frontal scout radiograph of the abdomen was performed. A rectal tube was inserted in usual sterile fashion, and retrograde instillation of barium contrast was followed via spot fluoroscopic images. A post-evacuation overhead radiograph of the abdomen was performed.FINDINGS: The scout radiograph demonstrates a nonobstructive gastrointestinal pattern. There are no suspicious calcifications seen or evidence of gross free intraperitoneal air. The visualized lung bases and osseous structures are within normal limits.The rectum and colon is of normal caliber throughout its course. There is no evidence of obstruction, as contrast is seen to flow without difficulty into the right colon and cecum. A small amount of contrast is seen to opacify small bowel loops on the post-evacuation image. There is also opacification of a normal-appearing appendix documented.IMPRESSION: Normal barium enema."
Gastroenterology,"The patient is a 60-year-old male, who self-reported history of head and neck cancer status post 35 radiation treatments and 6 weeks of chemotherapy between March 2008 and July 2008. The patient was referred for an outpatient speech and language pathology consult to increase speech and swallowing abilities. The patient is currently NPO with G-tube to meet all of his hydration and nutritional needs. He has been NPO since April 2008. The patient also has a trach, which she is currently using finger occlusion to achieve voicing.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lortab.PREVIOUS MEDICAL HISTORY: Cardiac stent in 2000.PATIENT'S GOAL: To eat again by mouth.STUDY: A trial of Passy-Muir valve was completed to allow the patient to achieve hands-free voicing and also to improve his secretion management. A clinical swallow evaluation was not completed due to the severity of the patient's mucus and lack of saliva control.The patient's laryngeal area was palpated during a dry swallow and he does have significantly reduced laryngeal elevation and radiation fibrosis. The further evaluate of his swallowing function is safety; a modified barium swallow study needs to be concluded to objectively evaluate his swallow safety, and to rule out aspiration. A trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy was completed to determine if this therapy protocol will be beneficial and improving the patient's swallowing function and safety.For his neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy, the type was BMR with a single mode cycle time is 4 seconds and 12 seconds off with frequency was 60 __________ with a ramp of 2 seconds, phase duration was 220 with an output of 99 milliamps. Electrodes were placed on the suprahyoid/submandibular triangle with an upright body position, trial length was 10 minutes. On a pain scale, the patient reported no pain with the electrical stimulation therapy.FINDINGS: The patient was able to tolerate a 5-minute placement of the Passy-Muir valve. He reported no discomfort on the inhalation; however, he felt some resistance on exhalation. Instructions were given on care placement and cleaning of the Passy-Muir valve. The patient was instructed to buildup tolerance over the next several days of his Passy-Muir valve and to remove the valve at anytime or he is going to be sleeping or napping throughout the day. The patient's voicing did improve with the Passy-Muir valve due to decreased leakage from his trach secondary to finger occlusion. Mucus production also seemed to decrease when the Passy-Muir was placed.On the dry swallow during this evaluation, the patient's laryngeal area is reduced and tissues around his larynx and showed radiation fibrosis. The patient's neck range of motion appears to be adequate and within normal limits.A trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy:The patient tolerating the neuromuscular electrical stimulation, we did achieve poor passive response, but these muscles were contracting and the larynx was moving upon stimulation. The patient was able to actively swallow with stimulation approximately 30% of presentation.DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: The patient with a history of head and neck cancer status post radiation and chemotherapy with radiation fibrosis, which is impeding his swallowing abilities. The patient would benefit from outpatient skilled speech therapy for neuromuscular electrical stimulation for muscle reeducation to improve his swallowing function and safety and he would benefit from a placement of a Passy-Muir valve to have hands-free communication.PLAN OF CARE: Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week to include neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy, Passy-Muir placement and a completion of the modified barium swallow study.SHORT-TERM GOALS (6 WEEKS):1. Completion of modified barium swallow study.2. The patient will coordinate volitional swallow with greater than 75% of the neuromuscular electrical stimulations.3. The patient will increase laryngeal elevation by 50% for airway protection.4. The patient will tolerate placement of Passy-Muir valve for greater than 2 hours during awaking hours.5. The patient will tolerate therapeutic feedings with the speech and language pathologist without signs and symptoms of aspiration.6. The patient will decrease mild facial restrictions to the anterior neck by 50% to increase laryngeal movement.LONG-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS):1. The patient will improve secretion management to tolerable levels.2. The patient will increase amount and oral consistency of p.o. intake tolerated without signs and symptoms of aspirations.3. The patient will be able to communicate without using finger occlusion with the assistance of a Passy-Muir valve."
Gastroenterology,"SUBJECTIVE: The patient is a 60-year-old female, who complained of coughing during meals. Her outpatient evaluation revealed a mild-to-moderate cognitive linguistic deficit, which was completed approximately 2 months ago. The patient had a history of hypertension and TIA/stroke. The patient denied history of heartburn and/or gastroesophageal reflux disorder. A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.OBJECTIVE: Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. ABC. The patient was seated upright in a video imaging chair throughout this assessment. To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); puree consistency (teaspoon x2); and solid food consistency (1/4 cracker x1).ASSESSMENTORAL STAGE: Premature spillage to the level of the valleculae and pyriform sinuses with thin liquid. Decreased tongue base retraction, which contributed to vallecular pooling after the swallow.PHARYNGEAL STAGE: No aspiration was observed during this evaluation. Penetration was noted with cup sips of thin liquid only. Trace residual on the valleculae and on tongue base with nectar-thick puree and solid consistencies. The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement are within functional limits. Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus. Radiologist noted reduced peristaltic action of the constricted muscles in the esophagus, which may be contributing to the patient's complaint of globus sensation.DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: No aspiration was noted during this evaluation. Penetration with cup sips of thin liquid. The patient did cough during this evaluation, but that was noted related to aspiration or penetration.PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: Based on this evaluation, the prognosis for swallowing and safety is good.PLAN: Based on this evaluation and following recommendations are being made:1. The patient to take small bite and small sips to help decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration.2. The patient should remain upright at a 90-degree angle for at least 45 minutes after meals to decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration as well as to reduce her globus sensation.3. The patient should be referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation of her esophageal function.The patient does not need any skilled speech therapy for her swallowing abilities at this time, and she is discharged from my services."
Gastroenterology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 71-year-old female, who was referred for an outpatient modified barium swallow study to objectively evaluate her swallowing function and safety. The patient complained of globus sensation high in her throat particularly with solid foods and with pills. She denied history of coughing and chocking with meals. The patient's complete medical history is unknown to me at this time. The patient was cooperative and compliant throughout this evaluation.STUDY: Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright at a 90-degree angle in a video imaging chair. To evaluate her swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of food and liquid mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3. cup sip x4); thickened liquid (cup sip x3); puree consistency (teaspoon x3); and solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1). The patient was given 2 additional cup sips of thin liquid following the puree and solid food presentation.ORAL STAGE: The patient had no difficulty with bolus control and transport. No spillage out lips. The patient appears to have pocketing __________ particularly with puree and solid food between her right faucial pillars. The patient did state that she had her tonsil taken out as a child and appears to be a diverticulum located in this state. Further evaluation by an ENT is highly recommended based on the residual and pooling that occurred during this evaluation. We were not able to clear out the residual with alternating cup sips and thin liquid.PHARYNGEAL STAGE: No aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation. The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movements are within the functional limits. Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits. She had no residual or pooling in the pharynx after the swallow.CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: The patient had no aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation. She does appear to have a diverticulum in the area between her right faucial pillars. Additional evaluation is needed by an ENT physician.PLAN: Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:1. The patient's diet should consist regular consistency food with thin liquids. She needs to take small bites and small sips to help decrease her risk of aspiration and penetration as well as reflux.2. The patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation of her oral cavity particularly the area between her faucial pillars.The above recommendations and results of the evaluation were discussed with the patient as well as her daughter and both responded appropriately.Thank you for the opportunity to be required the patient's medical care. She is not in need of skilled speech therapy and is discharged from my services."
Gastroenterology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 76-year-old male, with previous history of dysphagia, status post stroke. The patient stated that he was at Hospital, secondary to his stroke, where he had his initial modified barium swallow study. The patient stated that the results of that modified revealed aspiration with thin liquids only. He is currently eating and drinking without difficulty and he feels that he can return to a regular diet with thin liquids. A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.STUDY: Modified barium swallow study was performed in the radiology suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright and in a video-imaging chair throughout this assessment.To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, he was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3, cup sip x3); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x3); pureed consistency (teaspoon x3); solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).FINDINGSORAL STAGE: The patient had no spillage out lips. Oral residual after swallow with increased viscosity requiring multiple swallows to clear oral cavity.The patient has reduced lingual retraction contributing to vallecula pooling after the swallow. Trace premature spillage was noted with thin liquids during this assessment.PHARYNGEAL STAGE: Aspiration noted on cup sips of thin liquid. Trace-to-mild penetration with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid during and after the swallow. The penetration after the swallow occurred secondary to spillage on the piriform sinuses into the laryngeal vestibule. The patient has incomplete laryngeal closure, which allowed the aspiration and penetration with thin liquids. The patient had no aspiration or penetration occur with nectar-thick liquid, puree, and solid food. The patient has a mildly reduced hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement that leads to incomplete epiglottic inversion that contributes to vallecula pooling. Mild-to-moderate pooling in the vallecula after the swallow with liquids and puree, this residual did decrease with the solid feed presentation. The patient has mild residual of pooling in the piriform sinuses after a swallow that did clear with sequential swallows.CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: Mild aspiration with cup sips of thin liquid, penetration during and after the swallow with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid. No aspiration or penetration occurred with thick liquid, pureed, or solid food during this assessment.PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: With a modified diet, the patient's potential for swallowing safety is good.PLAN:Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:1. The patient should be on a regular diet with nectar-thick liquids to help prevent aspiration and penetration.2. The patient should have unthickened water in between meals to help decrease his risk of dehydration.3. The patient should complete good oral care two times a day to decrease bacterial growth in mouth.4. The patient should be seated at a 90-degree angle when eating and drinking, as well as take small bites and small sips to help decrease risk of aspiration and penetration and reflux.Thank you for the opportunity to evaluate the patient. I look forward to working with him in the outpatient setting to improve his swallowing function and safety. Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended for a trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy for muscle re-education, as well as to train patient to use swallowing techniques and maneuvers that should improve his swallowing function and safety."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hematemesis in a patient with longstanding diabetes. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Mallory-Weiss tear, submucosal hemorrhage consistent with trauma from vomiting and grade 2 esophagitis.PROCEDURE: The procedure, indications explained and he understood and agreed. He was sedated with Versed 3, Demerol 25 and topical Hurricane spray to the oropharynx. A bite block was placed. The Pentax video gastroscope was advanced through the oropharynx into the esophagus under direct vision. Esophagus revealed distal ulcerations. Additionally, the patient had a Mallory-Weiss tear. This was subjected to bicap cautery with good ablation. The stomach was entered, which revealed areas of submucosal hemorrhage consistent with trauma from vomiting. There were no ulcerations or erosions in the stomach. The duodenum was entered, which was unremarkable. The instrument was then removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.IMPRESSION: Mallory-Weiss tear, successful BICAP cautery. We will keep the patient on proton pump inhibitors. The patient will remain on antiemetics and be started on a clear liquid diet."

CBC was entirely within normal limits without any signs of anemia with an H and H of 14 and 42%. CMP also within normal limits. PTT, PT, and INR were normal. Attempts at getting the patient to give A urine were unsuccessful and the patient was very noncompliant, would not allow us to do any kind of Foley catheterization.ER COURSE: Uneventful. I have discussed the patient in full with Dr. X who agrees that she does not require any further workup or evaluation as an inpatient. We have decided to send the patient back to XYZ with observation by the staff there. She will have a CBC done daily for the next 3 days with results to Dr. X. They are to call him if there is any recurrences of blood or worsening of symptoms and they are to do a urinalysis at XYZ for blood.ASSESSMENT: Questionable gastrointestinal bleeding at this time, stable without any obvious signs otherwise of significant bleed."
Gastroenterology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Bright red blood per rectum HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 73-year-old woman had a recent medical history significant for renal and bladder cancer, deep venous thrombosis of the right lower extremity, and anticoagulation therapy complicated by lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Colonoscopy during that admission showed internal hemorrhoids and diverticulosis, but a bleeding site was not identified. Five days after discharge to a nursing home, she again experienced bloody bowel movements and returned to the emergency department for evaluation. REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS: No chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain or cramping, nausea, vomiting, or lightheadedness. Positive for generalized weakness and diarrhea the day of admission. PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY: Long-standing hypertension, intermittent atrial fibrillation, and hypercholesterolemia. Renal cell carcinoma and transitional cell bladder cancer status post left nephrectomy, radical cystectomy, and ileal loop diversion 6 weeks prior to presentation, postoperative course complicated by pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and retroperitoneal bleed.

LABS: CBC: WBC count: 6,500 per mL Hemoglobin: 10.3 g/dL Hematocrit:31.8% Platelet count: 248 per mL Mean corpuscular volume: 86.5 fL RDW: 18% CHEM 7: Sodium: 131 mmol/L Potassium: 3.5 mmol/L Chloride: 98 mmol/L Bicarbonate: 23 mmol/L BUN: 11 mg/dL Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL Glucose: 105 mg/dL COAGULATION STUDIES: PT 15.7 sec INR 1.6 PTT 29.5 sec HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient received 1 liter normal saline and diltiazem (a total of 20 mg intravenously and 30 mg orally) in the emergency department. Emergency department personnel made several attempts to place a nasogastric tube for gastric lavage, but were unsuccessful. During her evaluation, the patient was noted to desaturate to 80% on room air, with an increase in her respiratory rate to 34 breaths per minute. She was administered 50% oxygen by nonrebreadier mask, with improvement in her oxygen saturation to 89%. Computed tomographic angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism. The patient was admitted to the medicine service for further workup and management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypoxia. She was alert, awake, and hemodynamically stable, but remained tachypneic and hypoxic despite high-flow oxygen. She continued to perseverate on the fact that she had been unable to swallow the nasogastric tube earlier in the evening """"even with that banana spray"""" (topical benzocaine 20%). While obtaining a sample for arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, the medical team noted that the blood was abnormally dark. The sample was sent for co-oximetry as well, which revealed a methemoglobin level of 15.2%. ABG showed a pH of 7.41, PCO2 31 mmHg, PO2 374 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient was treated with methylene blue, with rapid resolution of tachypnea and improvement of oxygen saturation to 97% on 2 liters nasal cannula."
Gastroenterology,"REASON FOR CONSULT: I was asked to see the patient for C. diff colitis.HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: Briefly, the patient is a very pleasant 72-year-old female with previous history of hypertension and also recent diagnosis of C. diff for which she was admitted here in 5/2009, who presents to the hospital on 6/18/2009 with abdominal pain, cramping, and persistent diarrhea. After admission, she had a CT of the abdomen done, which showed evidence of diffuse colitis and she was started on IV Flagyl and also on IV Levaquin. She was also placed on IV Reglan because of nausea and vomiting. In spite of the above, her white count still continues to be elevated today. On questioning the patient, she states the nausea and vomiting has resolved, but the diarrhea still present, but otherwise denies any other specific complaints except for some weakness.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent C. diff colitis, which had resolved based on speaking to Dr. X. Two weeks ago, he had seen the patient and she was clinically well.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Noncontributory.SOCIAL HISTORY: No history of smoking, alcohol, or drug use. She lives at home.HOME MEDICATIONS: She is on atenolol and Mevacor.ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for diarrhea and abdominal pain, otherwise main other complaints are weakness. She denies any cough, sputum production, or dysuria at this time. Otherwise, a 10-system review is essentially negative.PHYSICAL EXAM:GENERAL: She is awake and alert, currently in no apparent distress.VITAL SIGNS: She has been afebrile since admission, temperature today 96.5, heart rate 80, respirations 18, blood pressure 125/60, and O2 sat is 98% on 2 L.HEENT: Pupils are round and reactive to light and accommodation.CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.CARDIOVASCULAR: S1 and S2 are present. No rales appreciated.ABDOMEN: She does have tenderness to palpation all over with some mild rebound tenderness also. No guarding noted. Bowel sounds present.EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.CT of the abdomen and pelvis is also reviewed on the computer, which showed evidence of diffuse colitis.LABORATORY: White blood cell count today 21.5, hemoglobin 12.4, platelet count 284,000, and neutrophils 89. UA on 6/18/2009 showed no evidence of UTI. Sodium today 130, potassium 2.7, and creatinine 0.4. AST and ALT on 6/20/2009 were normal. Blood cultures from admission were negative. Urine culture on admission was negative. C. diff was positive. Stool culture was negative.ASSESSMENT:1. A 72-year-old female with Clostridium difficile colitis.2. Diarrhea secondary to above and also could be related Reglan, which was discontinued today.3. Leukocytosis secondary to above, mild improvement today though.4. Bilateral pleural effusion by CT of the chest, although could represent thickening.5. New requirement for oxygen, rule out pneumonia.6. Hypertension.PLAN:1. Treat the C. diff aggressively especially given CT appearance and her continued leukocytosis and because of the Levaquin, which could have added additional antibiotic pressure, so I will restart the IV Flagyl.2. Continue p.o. vancomycin. Add Florastor to help replenish the gut flora.3. Monitor WBCs closely and follow clinically and if there is any deterioration in her clinical status, I would recommend getting surgical evaluation immediately for surgery if needed.4. We will check a chest x-ray especially given her new requirement for oxygen."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cecal polyp.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cecal polyp.PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic resection of cecal polyp.COMPLICATIONS: None.ANESTHESIA: General oral endotracheal intubation.PROCEDURE: After adequate general anesthesia was administered the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped aseptically. Local anesthetic was infiltrated into the right upper quadrant where a small incision was made. Blunt dissection was carried down to the fascia which was grasped with Kocher clamps. A bladed 11-mm port was inserted without difficulty. Pneumoperitoneum was obtained using C02. Under direct vision 2 additional, non-bladed, 11-mm trocars were placed, one in the left lower quadrant and one in the right lower quadrant. There was some adhesion noted to the anterior midline which was taken down using the harmonic scalpel. The cecum was visualized and found to have tattoo located almost opposite the ileocecal valve. This was in what appeared to be an appropriate location for removal of this using the Endo GIA stapler without impinging on the ileocecal valve or the appendiceal orifice. The appendix was somewhat retrocecal in position but otherwise looked normal. The patient was also found to have ink marks in the peritoneal cavity diffusely indicating possible extravasation of dye. There was enough however in the wall to identify the location of the polyp. The lesion was grasped with a Babcock clamp and an Endo GIA stapler used to fire across this transversely. The specimen was then removed through the 12-mm port and examined on the back table. The lateral margin was found to be closely involved with the specimen so I did not feel that it was clear. I therefore lifted the lateral apex of the previous staple line and created a new staple line extending more laterally around the colon. This new staple line was then opened on the back table and examined. There was some residual polypoid material noted but the margins this time appeared to be clear. The peritoneal cavity was then lavaged with antibiotic solution. There were a few small areas of bleeding along the staple line which were treated with pinpoint electrocautery. The trocars were removed under direct vision. No bleeding was noted. The bladed trocar site was closed using a figure-of-eight O Vicryl suture. All skin incisions were closed with running 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures. Mastisol and Steri-Strips were placed followed by sterile Tegaderm dressing. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications."
Gastroenterology,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Newly diagnosed cholangiocarcinoma.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a very pleasant 77-year-old female who is noted to have an increase in her liver function tests on routine blood work in December 2009. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge and gallbladder findings consistent with adenomyomatosis. Common bile duct was noted to be 10 mm in size on that ultrasound. She then underwent a CT scan of the abdomen in July 2010, which showed intrahepatic ductal dilatation with the common bile duct size being 12.7 mm. She then underwent an MRI MRCP, which was notable for stricture of the distal common bile duct. She was then referred to gastroenterology and underwent an ERCP. On August 24, 2010, she underwent the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. She was noted to have a stricturing mass of the mid-to-proximal common bile duct consistent with cholangiocarcinoma. A temporary biliary stent was placed across the biliary stricture. Blood work was obtained during the hospitalization. She was also noted to have an elevated CA99. She comes in to clinic today for initial Medical Oncology consultation. After she sees me this morning, she has a follow-up consultation with a surgeon.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In July, she had eye surgery on her left eye for a muscle repair. Other surgeries include left ankle surgery for a fractured ankle in 2000.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Diovan 80/12.5 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, Lutein 20 mg daily, folic acid 0.8 mg daily and multivitamin daily.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for heart disease. She had three brothers that died of complications from open heart surgery. Her parents and brothers all had hypertension. Her younger brother died at the age of 18 of infection from a butcher's shop. He was cutting Argentinean beef and contracted an infection and died within 24 hours. She has one brother that is living who has angina and a sister who is 84 with dementia. She has two adult sons who are in good health.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has been married to her second husband for the past ten years. Her first husband died in 1995. She does not have a smoking history and does not drink alcohol.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient reports a change in her bowels ever since she had the stent placed. She has noted some weight loss, but she notes that that is due to not eating very well. She has had some mild fatigue, but prior to her diagnosis she had absolutely no symptoms. As mentioned above, she was noted to have abnormal alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, AST and ALT, which prompted the followup. She has had some difficulty with her vision that has improved with her recent surgical procedure. She denies any fevers, chills, night sweats. She has had loose stools. The rest of her review of systems is negative.PHYSICAL EXAM:VITALS: BP: 108/60. HEART RATE: 80. TEMP: 98.5. Weight: 75 kg.GEN: She is a very pleasant female, in no acute distress.HEENT: She has obvious strabismus of the left eye with medial deviation. Her pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Oropharynx is clear.NECK: Supple. She has no cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy.LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.CV: Regular rate; normal S1, S2, no murmurs.ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended. No palpable masses. No hepatosplenomegaly.EXT: Lower extremities are without edema.LABORATORY STUDIES: Sodium 141, glucose 111, total bilirubin 2.3, alkaline phosphatase 941, AST 161, and ALT 220. White blood cell count 4.3, hemoglobin 11.6, hematocrit 35, and platelets 156,000. Total bilirubin from August 25, 2010 was 1.6, alkaline phosphatase 735, AST 123, ALT 184, CA99 is 109. Bile duct brushings are notable for atypical cell clusters present, highly suspicious for carcinoma.ASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a very pleasant 77-year-old female who has findings suspicious for a cholangiocarcinoma. The patient was referred to our office to discuss this diagnosis. I spent greater than an hour with the patient and her husband discussing this potential diagnosis, reviewing the anatomy and answering questions. She is yet to have a surgical consultation, and we discussed the difficulty that we sometimes have with patients meeting surgical criteria to manage cholangiocarcinoma. The patient also had questions about the Medical University and possibly seeking a second opinion. She will contact our office after her surgical consultation if she needs assistance with obtaining a second opinion. We also talked about our clinical research program here. Currently, we do have a Phase II Study for advanced gallbladder carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma for patients that are unresectable. We will go ahead and provide her with a consent form so that she can look that over and it will give her some more information about the malignancy and treatment approaches. We will schedule her for followup in three weeks. We will also schedule her for PET/CT scan for staging."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):1. Cholelithiasis.2. Cholecystitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):1. Acute perforated gangrenous cholecystitis.2. Cholelithiasis.PROCEDURE:1. Attempted laparoscopic cholecystectomy.2. Open cholecystectomy.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia.COUNTS: Correct.COMPLICATIONS: None apparent.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 275 mL.SPECIMENS:1. Gallbladder.2. Lymph node.DRAINS: One 19-French round Blake.DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION: After consent was obtained and the patient was properly identified, the patient was transported to the operating room and after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a normal sterile fashion.After infiltration with local, a vertical incision was made at the umbilicus and utilizing graspers, the underlying fascia was incised and was divided sharply. Dissecting further, the peritoneal cavity was entered. Once this done, a Hasson trocar was secured with #1 Vicryl and the abdomen was insufflated without difficulty. A camera was placed into the abdomen and there was noted to be omentum overlying the subhepatic space. A second trocar was placed in the standard fashion in the subxiphoid area; this was a 10/12 mm non-bladed trocar. Once this was done, a grasper was used to try and mobilize the omentum and a second grasper was added in the right costal margin; this was a 5-mm port placed, it was non-bladed and placed in the usual fashion under direct visualization without difficulty. A grasper was used to mobilize free the omentum which was acutely friable and after a significant time-consuming effort was made to mobilize the omentum, it was clear that the gallbladder was well incorporated by the omentum and it would be unsafe to proceed with a laparoscopy procedure and then the procedure was converted to open.The trocars were removed and a right subcostal incision was made incorporating the 10/12 subxiphoid port. The subcutaneous space was divided with electrocautery, as well as the muscles and fascia. The Bookwalter retraction system was then set up and retractors were placed to provide exposure to the right subhepatic space. Then utilizing a right-angle and electrocautery, the omentum was freed from the gallbladder. An ensuing retrograde cholecystectomy was performed, in which, electrocautery and blunt dissection were used to mobilize the gallbladder from the gallbladder fossa; this was done down to the infundibulum. After meticulous dissection, the cystic artery was identified and it was ligated between 3-0 silks. Several other small ties were placed on smaller bleeding vessels and the cystic duct was identified, was skeletonized, and a 3-0 stick tie was placed on the proximal portion of it. After it was divided, the gallbladder was freed from the field.Once this was done, the liver bed was inspected for hemostasis and this was achieved with electrocautery. Copious irrigation was also used. A 19-French Blake drain was placed in Morrison's pouch lateral to the gallbladder fossa and was secured in place with 2-0 nylon; this was a 19-French round Blake. Once this was done, the umbilical port was closed with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion and then the wound was closed in two layers with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion. The skin was closed with and absorbable stitch.The patient was then awakened from anesthesia, extubated, and transported to the recovery room in stable condition."

Cholelithiasis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram.ANESTHESIA: General.INDICATIONS: This is a 38-year-old diabetic Hispanic female patient, with ongoing recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant pain, associated with nausea. Ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis. The patient also had somewhat thickened gallbladder wall. The patient was admitted through emergency room last night with acute onset right upper quadrant pain. Clinically, it was felt the patient had acute cholecystitis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram was advised. Procedure, indication, risk, and alternative were discussed with the patient in detail preoperatively and informed consent was obtained.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia, and abdomen was prepped and draped. A small transverse incision was made just above the umbilicus under local anesthesia. Fascia was opened vertically. Stay sutures were placed in the fascia. Peritoneal cavity was carefully entered. Hasson cannula was inserted and peritoneal cavity was insufflated with CO2.Laparoscopic camera was inserted, and the patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg, rotated to the left. A 11-mm trocar was placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5-mm in the right subcostal region. Examination at this time showed no free fluid, no acute inflammatory changes. Liver was grossly normal. Gallbladder was noted to be thickened. Gallbladder wall with a stone stuck in the neck of the gallbladder and pericholecystic edema, consistent with acute cholecystitis.The fundus of the gallbladder was retracted superiorly, and dissection was carried at the neck of the gallbladder where a cystic duct was identified and isolated. It was clipped distally and using C-arm fluoroscopy, intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram was done, which was interpreted as normal. There was slight dilatation noted at the junction of the right and left hepatic duct, but no filling defects or any other pathology was noted. It was presumed that this was probably a congenital anomaly. The cystic duct was clipped twice proximally and divided beyond the clips. Cystic artery was identified, isolated, clipped twice proximally, once distally, and divided.The gallbladder was then removed from its bed using cautery dissection and subsequently delivered through the umbilical port. Specimen was sent for histopathology. Subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic spaces were irrigated with sterile saline solution. Hemostasis was good. Trocars were removed under direct vision and peritoneal cavity was evacuated with CO2. Umbilical area fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl figure-of-eight sutures, required extra sutures to close the fascial defect. Some difficulty was encountered closing the fascia initially because of the patient's significant amount of subcutaneous fat. In the end, the repair appears to be quite satisfactory. Rest of the incisions closed with 3-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissues and staples for the skin. Sterile dressing was applied.The patient transferred to recovery room in stable condition."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gallstone pancreatitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gallstone pancreatitis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal and local injectable Marcaine.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.SPECIMEN: Gallbladder.COMPLICATIONS: None.OPERATIVE FINDINGS: Video laparoscopy revealed dense omental adhesions surrounding the gallbladder circumferentially. These dense adhesions were associated with chronic inflammatory edematous changes. The cystic duct was easily identifiable and seen entering into the gallbladder and clipped two proximally and one distally. The cystic artery was an anomalous branch that was anterior to the cystic duct and was identified, clipped with two clips proximally and one distally. The remainder of the evaluation of the abdomen revealed no evidence of nodularity or masses in the liver. There was no evidence of adhesions from the abdominal wall to the liver. The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 17-year-old African-American female who presented to ABCD General Hospital on 08/20/2003 with complaints of intractable right upper quadrant abdominal pain. She had been asked to follow up and scheduled for surgery previously. Her pain had now been intractable associated with anorexia. She was noted on physical examination to be afebrile; however, she was having severe right upper quadrant pain with examination as well as a Murphy's sign and voluntary guarding with examination. Her transaminases were markedly elevated. She also developed pancreatitis secondary to gallstones. Her common bile duct was dilated to 1 cm with no evidence of wall thickening, but evidence of cholelithiasis. She was seen by the gastroenterologist and underwent a sphincterotomy with balloon extraction of gallstones secondary to choledocholithiasis. Following this, she was scheduled for operative laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Her parents were explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure. She gave us informed consent to proceed with surgery.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position. Preoperatively, the patient received IV antibiotics of Ancef, sequential compression devices and subcutaneous heparin. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution. Utilizing a #15 blade scalpel, a transverse infraumbilical incision was created. Utilizing a Veress needle with anterior traction on the anterior abdominal wall with a towel clamp, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty. Hanging water drop test was performed with notable air aspiration through the Veress needle and the saline passed through the Veress needle without difficulty. The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg with carbon-dioxide. Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a #10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty. Video laparoscope was inserted and the above notable findings were identified in the operative findings. The patient to proceed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy was decided and a subxiphoid port was placed. A #15 bladed scalpel was used to make a transverse incision in the subxiphoid region within the midline. The trocar was then inserted into the abdomen under direct visualization with the video laparoscope and seen to go to the right of falciform ligament. Next, two 5 mm trocars were inserted under direct visualization, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior midaxillary line. These were inserted without difficulty. The liver edge was lifted and revealed a markedly edematous gallbladder with severe omental adhesions encapsulating the gallbladder. Utilizing Endoshears scissor, a plane was created circumferentially to the dome of the gallbladder to allow assistance and dissection of these dense adhesions. Next, the omental adhesions adjacent to the infundibulum were taken down and allowed to expose the cystic duct. A small vessel was seen anterior to the cystic duct and this was clipped two proximally and one distally and noted to be an anomalous arterial branch. This was transected with Endoshears scissor and visualized the pulsatile branch with two clips securely in place. Next, the cystic duct was carefully dissected with Maryland dissectors and was visualized clearly both anterior and posteriorly. Endoclips were placed two proximally and one distally and then the cystic duct was transected with Endoshears scissor.Once the clips were noted to be in place, utilizing electrocautery another Dorsey dissector was used to carefully dissect the gallbladder off the liver bed wall. The gallbladder was removed and the bleeding from the gallbladder wall was easily controlled with electrocautery. The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline. The gallbladder was grasped with a gallbladder grasper and removed from the subxiphoid port. There was noted to be gallstones within the gallbladder. Once the abdomen was re-insufflated after removing the gallbladder and copious irrigation was performed, all ports were then removed under direct visualization with no evidence of bleeding from the anterior abdominal wall. Utilizing #0 Vicryl suture, a figure-of-eight was placed to the subxiphoid and infraumbilical fascia and this was approximated without difficulty. The subxiphoid port was irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline prior to closure of the fascia. A #4-0 Vicryl suture was used to approximate all incisions. The incisions were then injected with local injectable 0.25% Marcaine. All ports were then cleaned dry. Steri-Strips were placed across and sterile pressure dressings were placed on top of this. The patient tolerated the entire procedure well. She was transferred to the Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition. She will be followed closely in the postoperative course in General Medical Floor."
Gastroenterology,"REASON FOR ADMISSION: Cholecystitis with choledocholithiasis.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis.ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES1. Status post roux-en-y gastric bypass converted to an open procedure in 01/07.2. Laparoscopic paraventral hernia in 11/07.3. History of sleep apnea with reversal after 100-pound weight loss.4. Morbid obesity with bmi of 39.4.PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with laparoscopy converted to open common bile duct exploration and stone extraction.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 33-year-old female admitted with elevated bilirubin and probable common bile duct stone. She was admitted through the emergency room with abdominal pain, elevated bilirubin, and gallstones on ultrasound with a dilated common bile duct. She subsequently went for a HIDA scan to rule out cholecystitis. Gallbladder was filled but was unable to empty into the small bowel consistent with the common bile duct blockage. She was taken to the operating room that night for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We proceeded with laparoscopic cholecystectomy and during the cholangiogram there was no contrast. It was able to be extravasated into the duodenum with the filling defect consistent with the distal common bile duct stone. The patient had undergone a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass but could not receive an ERCP and stone extraction, therefore, common bile duct exploration was performed and a stone was extracted. This necessitated conversion to an open operation. She was transferred to the medical surgical unit postoperatively. She had a significant amount of incisional pain following morning, but no nausea. A Jackson-Pratt drain, which was left in place in two places showed serosanguineous fluid. White blood cell count was down to 7500 and bilirubin decreased to 2.1. Next morning she was started on a liquid diet. Foley catheter was discontinued. There was no evidence of bile leak from the drains. She was advanced to a regular diet on postoperative day #3, which was 12/09/07. The following morning she was tolerating regular diet. Her bowels had begun to function, and she was afebrile with her pain control with oral pain medications. Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued from the wound. The remaining Jackson-Pratt drain was left adjacent to her cystic duct. Following morning, her laboratory studies were better. Her bilirubin was down to normal and white blood cell count was normal with an H&H of 9 and 26.3. Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued, and she was discharged home. Followup was in 3 days for staple removal. She was given iron 325 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Lortab elixir 15 cc p.o. q.4 h. p.r.n. for pain."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute acalculous cholecystitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute acalculous cholecystitis.PROCEDURE: Placement of cholecystostomy tube under ultrasound guidance.ANESTHESIA: Xylocaine 1% With Epinephrine.INDICATIONS: Patient is a pleasant 75-year-old gentleman who is about one week status post an acute MI who also has acute cholecystitis. Because it is not safe to take him to the operating room for general anesthetic, I recommended he undergo the above-named procedure. Procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, and alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable to surgery.TECHNIQUE: Patient was identified, then taken to the Radiology suite, where the area of interest was identified using ultrasound and prepped with Betadine solution, draped in sterile fashion. After infiltration with 1% Xylocaine and after multiple attempts, the gallbladder was finally cannulated by Dr. Kindred using the Cook 18-French needle. The guidewire was then placed and via Seldinger technique, a 10-French pigtail catheter was placed within the gallbladder, secured using the Cook catheter method, and dressings were applied and patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition."

Gastroenterology,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: I was asked by Dr. X to see the patient in consultation for a new diagnosis of colon cancer.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient presented to medical attention after she noticed mild abdominal cramping in February 2007. At that time, she was pregnant and was unsure if her symptoms might have been due to the pregnancy. Unfortunately, she had miscarriage at about seven weeks. She again had abdominal cramping, severe, in late March 2007. She underwent colonoscopy on 04/30/2007 by Dr. Y. Of note, she is with a family history of early colon cancers and had her first colonoscopy at age 35 and no polyps were seen at that time.On colonoscopy, she was found to have a near-obstructing lesion at the splenic flexure. She was not able to have the scope passed past this lesion. Pathology showed a colon cancer, although I do not have a copy of that report at this time.She had surgical resection done yesterday. The surgery was laparoscopic assisted with anastomosis. At the time of surgery, lymph nodes were palpable.Pathology showed colon adenocarcinoma, low grade, measuring 3.8 x 1.7 cm, circumferential and invading in to the subserosal mucosa greater than 5 mm, 13 lymph nodes were negative for metastasis. There was no angiolymphatic invasion noted. Radial margin was 0.1 mm. Other margins were 5 and 6 mm. Testing for microsatellite instability is still pending.Staging has already been done with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This showed a mass at the splenic flexure, mildly enlarged lymph nodes there, and no evidence of metastasis to liver, lungs, or other organs. The degenerative changes were noted at L5-S1. The ovaries were normal. An intrauterine device (IUD) was present in the uterus.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She has otherwise been feeling well. She has not had fevers, night sweats, or noticed lymphadenopathy. She has not had cough, shortness of breath, back pain, bone pain, blood in her stool, melena, or change in stool caliber. She was eating well up until the time of her surgery. She is up-to-date on mammography, which will be due again in June. She has no history of pulmonary, cardiac, renal, hepatic, thyroid, or central nervous system (CNS) disease.ALLERGIES: PENICILLIN, WHICH CAUSED HIVES WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD.MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION: None.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: No significant medical problem. She has had three miscarriages, all of them at about seven weeks. She has no prior surgeries.SOCIAL HISTORY: She smoked cigarettes socially while in her 20s. A pack of cigarettes would last for more than a week. She does not smoke now. She has two glasses of wine per day, both red and white wine. She is married and has no children. An IUD was recently placed. She works as an esthetician.FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of stage IV colon cancer at age 45. This occurred when the patient was young and she is not sure of the rest of the paternal family history. She does believe that aunts and uncles on that side may have died early. Her brother died of pancreas cancer at age 44. Another brother is aged 52 and he had polyps on colonoscopy a couple of years ago. Otherwise, he has no medical problem. Mother is aged 82 and healthy. She was recently diagnosed with hemochromatosis.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: She is in no acute distress.VITAL SIGNS: The patient is afebrile with a pulse of 78, respirations 16, blood pressure 124/70, and pulse oximetry is 93% on 3 L of oxygen by nasal cannula.SKIN: Warm and dry. She has no jaundice.LYMPHATICS: No cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes are palpable.LUNGS: There is no respiratory distress.CARDIAC: Regular rate.ABDOMEN: Soft and mildly tender. Dressings are clean and dry.EXTREMITIES: No peripheral edema is noted. Sequential compression devices (SCDs) are in place.LABORATORY DATA: White blood count of 11.7, hemoglobin 12.8, hematocrit 37.8, platelets 408, differential shows left shift, MCV is 99.6. Sodium is 136, potassium 4.1, bicarb 25, chloride 104, BUN 5, creatinine 0.7, and glucose is 133. Calcium is 8.8 and magnesium is 1.8.IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Newly diagnosed stage II colon cancer, with a stage T3c, N0, M0 colon cancer, grade 1. She does not have high-risk factors such as high grade or angiolymphatic invasion, and adequate number of lymph nodes were sampled. Although, the tumor was near obstructing, she was not having symptoms and in fact was having normal bowel movements.A lengthy discussion was held with the patient regarding her diagnosis and prognosis. Firstly, she has a good prognosis for being cured without adjuvant therapy. I would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age. Referring to the database that had been online, she has a 13% chance of relapse in the next five years, and with aggressive chemotherapy (X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) platinum-based), this would be reduced to an 8% risk of relapse with a 5% benefit. Chemotherapy with 5-FU based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 2.5%.Plan was made to allow her to recuperate and then meet with her and her husband to discuss the pros and cons of adjuvant chemotherapy including what regimen she could consider including the side effects. We did not review all that information today.She has a family history of early colon cancer. Her mother will be visiting in the weekend and plan is to obtain the rest of the paternal family history if we can. Tumor is being tested for microsatellite instability and we will discuss this when those results are available. She has one sibling and he is up-to-date on colonoscopy. She does report multiple tubes of blood were drawn prior to her admission. I will check with Dr. Y's office whether she has had a CEA and liver-associated enzymes assessed. If not, those can be drawn tomorrow."

Gastroenterology,"MEDICATIONS:1. Versed intravenously.2. Demerol intravenously.DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and sedated with the above medications. The Olympus video colonoscope was inserted through the anus and was advanced in retrograde fashion through the sigmoid colon, descending colon, around the splenic flexure, into the transverse colon, around the hepatic flexure, down the ascending colon, into the cecum. The cecum was identified by the presence of the appendiceal orifice and the ileocecal valve. The colonoscope was then advanced through the ileocecal valve into the terminal ileum, which was normal on examination. The scope was then pulled back into the cecum and then slowly withdrawn. The mucosa was examined in detail. The mucosa was entirely normal. Upon reaching the rectum, retroflex examination of the rectum was normal. The scope was then straightened out, the air removed and the scope withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no apparent complications."
Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Following instructions and completion of an oral colonoscopy prep, the patient, having been properly informed of, with signature consenting to total colonoscopy and indicated procedures, the patient received premedications of Vistaril 50 mg, Atropine 0.4 mg IM, and then intravenous medications of Demerol 50 mg and Versed 5 mg IV. Perirectal inspection was normal. The Olympus video colonoscope then was introduced into the rectum and passed by directed vision to the cecum and into the terminal ileum. No abnormalities were seen of the terminal ileum, the ileocecal valve, cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, descending colon, rectosigmoid and rectum. Retroflexion exam in the rectum revealed no other abnormality and withdrawal terminated the procedure."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: History of polyps.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Normal colonoscopy, left colonic diverticular disease.2. 3+ benign prostatic hypertrophy.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Total colonoscopy and photography.GROSS FINDINGS: This is a 74-year-old white male here for recheck colonoscopy for a history of polyps. After signed informed consent, blood pressure monitoring, EKG monitoring, and pulse oximetry monitoring, he was brought to the Endoscopic Suite. He was given 100 mg of Demerol, 3 mg of Versed IV push slowly. Digital examination revealed a large prostate for which he is following up with his urologist. No nodules. 3+ BPH. Anorectal canal was within normal limits. No stricture tumor or ulcer. The Olympus CF 20L video endoscope was inserted per anus. The anorectal canal was visualized, was normal. The sigmoid, descending, splenic, and transverse showed scattered diverticula. The hepatic, ascending, cecum, and ileocecal valve was visualized and was normal. The colonoscope was removed. The air was aspirated. The patient was discharged with high-fiber, diverticular diet. Recheck colonoscopy three years."
Gastroenterology,"PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: History of colon polyps and partial colon resection, right colon.POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSES: 1. Normal operative site. 2. Mild diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. 3. Hemorrhoids.PROCEDURE: Total colonoscopy.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient is a 60-year-old of Dr. ABC's being evaluated for the above. The patient also apparently had an x-ray done at the Hospital and it showed a dark spot, and because of this, a colonoscopy was felt to be needed. She was prepped the night before and on the morning of the test with oral Fleet's, brought to the second floor and sedated with a total of 50 mg of Demerol and 3.75 mg of Versed IV push. Digital rectal exam was done, unremarkable. At that point, the Pentax video colonoscope was inserted. The rectal vault appeared normal. The sigmoid showed diverticula throughout, mild to moderate in nature. The scope was then passed through the descending and transverse colon over to the hepatic flexure area and then the anastomosis site was visualized. The scope was passed a short distance up the ileum, which appeared normal. The scope was then withdrawn through the transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectal vault area. The scope was then retroflexed, and anal verge visualized showed some hemorrhoids. The scope was then removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well.RECOMMENDATIONS: Repeat colonoscopy in three years."
Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Change in bowel habits and rectal prolapse.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Normal colonoscopy.PROCEDURE: The Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon to the cecum identified by the ileocecal valve and the appendiceal orifice. The preparation was poor, but mucosa was visible after lavage and suction. Small lesions might have been missed in certain places, but no large lesions are likely to have been missed. The mucosa was normal, was visualized. In particular, there was no mucosal abnormality in the rectum and distal sigmoid, which is reported to be prolapsing. Biopsies were taken from the rectal wall to look for microscopic changes. The anal sphincter was considerably relaxed, with no tone and a gaping opening. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room.FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Normal colonic mucosa to the cecum. No contraindications to consideration of a repair of the prolapse."
Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Rectal bleeding and perirectal abscess.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Perianal abscess.MEDICATIONS: MAC.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon into the cecum and then through the ileocecal valve into the terminal ileum. The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen. The mucosa throughout the colon and in the terminal ileum was normal, with no evidence of colitis. Special attention was paid to the rectum, including retroflexed views of the distal rectum and the anorectal junction. There was no evidence of either inflammation or a fistulous opening. The scope was withdrawn. A careful exam of the anal canal and perianal area demonstrated a jagged 8-mm opening at the anorectal junction posteriorly (12 o'clock position). Some purulent material could be expressed through the opening. There was no suggestion of significant perianal reservoir of inflamed tissue or undrained material. Specifically, the posterior wall of the distal rectum and anal canal were soft and unremarkable. In addition, scars were noted in the perianal area. The first was a small dimpled scar, 1 cm from the anal verge in the 11 o'clock position. The second was a dimpled scar about 5 cm from the anal verge on the left buttock's cheek. There were no other abnormalities noted. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.FINAL DIAGNOSES:1. Normal colonoscopy to the terminal ileum.2. Opening in the skin at the external anal verge, consistent with drainage from a perianal abscess, with no palpable abscess at this time, and with no evidence of fistulous connection to the bowel lumen.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Continue antibiotics.2. Followup with Dr. X.3. If drainage persists, consider surgical drainage."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Colon polyps.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Universal diverticulosis.2. Nonsurgical internal hemorrhoids.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Total colonoscopy with photos.ANESTHESIA: Demerol 100 mg IV with Versed 3 mg IV.SPECIMENS: None.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 62-year-old white male who presents to the office with a history of colon polyps and need for recheck.PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained. All risks and benefits of the procedure were explained and all questions were answered. The patient was brought back to the Endoscopy Suite where he was connected to cardiopulmonary monitoring. Demerol 100 mg IV and Versed 3 mg IV was given in a titrated fashion until appropriate anesthesia was obtained. Upon appropriate anesthesia, a digital rectal exam was performed, which showed no masses. The colonoscope was then placed into the anus and the air was insufflated. The scope was then advanced under direct vision into the rectum, rectosigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon until it reached the cecum. Upon entering the sigmoid colon and throughout the rest of the colon, there was noted diverticulosis. After reaching the cecum, the scope was fully withdrawn visualizing all walls again noting universal diverticulosis.Upon reaching the rectum, the scope was then retroflexed upon itself and there was noted to be nonsurgical internal hemorrhoids. The scope was then subsequently removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Possible inflammatory bowel disease.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Polyp of the sigmoid colon.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Total colonoscopy with photography and polypectomy.GROSS FINDINGS: The patient had a history of ischiorectal abscess. He has been evaluated now for inflammatory bowel disease. Upon endoscopy, the colon prep was good. We were able to reach the cecum without difficulty. There are no diverticluli, inflammatory bowel disease, strictures, or obstructing lesions. There was a pedunculated polyp approximately 4.5 cm in size located in the sigmoid colon at approximately 35 cm. This large polyp was removed using the snare technique.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the endoscopy suite, prepped and draped in left lateral decubitus position. IV sedation was given by Anesthesia Department. The Olympus videoscope was inserted into anus. Using air insufflation, the colonoscope was advanced through the anus to the rectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon and cecum, the above gross findings were noted. The colonoscope was slowly withdrawn and carefully examined the lumen of the bowel. When the polyp again was visualized, the snare was passed around the polyp. It required at least two to three passes of the snare to remove the polyp in its totality. There was a large stalk on the polyp. ________ the polyp had been removed down to the junction of the polyp in the stalk, which appeared to be cauterized and no residual adenomatous tissue was present. No bleeding was identified. The colonoscope was then removed and patient was sent to recovery room in stable condition."

The colonoscope was inserted into the rectal ampulla and advanced to the cecum. The position of the scope within the cecum was verified by identification of the appendiceal orifice. The cecum, the ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, descending colon, and rectum were normal. The scope was retroflexed in the rectum and no abnormality was seen. So the scope was straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated.ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION:1. Normal colonoscopy.2. External hemorrhoids."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Screening. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tiny Polyps.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy.PROCEDURE: The procedure, indications, and risks were explained to the patient, who understood and agreed. He was sedated with Versed 3 mg, Demerol 25 mg during the examination. A digital rectal exam was performed and the Pentax Video Colonoscope was advanced over the examiner's finger into the rectum. It was passed to the level of the cecum. The ileocecal valve was identified, as was the appendiceal orifice. Slowly withdrawal through the colon revealed a small polyp in the transverse colon. This was approximately 3 mm in size and was completely removed using multiple bites with cold biopsy forceps. In addition, there was a 2 mm polyp versus lymphoid aggregate in the descending colon. This was also removed using the cold biopsy forceps. Further detail failed to reveal any other lesions with the exception of small hemorrhoids. IMPRESSION: Tiny polyps. PLAN: If adenomatous, repeat exam in five years. Otherwise, repeat exam in 10 years."
Gastroenterology,"OPERATIVE PROCEDURES: Colonoscopy and biopsies, epinephrine sclerotherapy, hot biopsy cautery, and snare polypectomy.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Colon cancer screening.2. Family history of colon polyps.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Multiple colon polyps (5).2. Diverticulosis, sigmoid colon.3. Internal hemorrhoids.ENDOSCOPE USED: EC3870LK.BIOPSIES: Biopsies taken from all polyps. Hot biopsy got applied to one. Epinephrine sclerotherapy and snare polypectomy applied to four polyps.ANESTHESIA: Fentanyl 75 mcg, Versed 6 mg, and glucagon 1.5 units IV push in divided doses. Also given epinephrine 1:20,000 total of 3 mL.The patient tolerated the procedure well.PROCEDURE: The patient was placed in left lateral decubitus after appropriate sedation. Digital rectal examination was done, which was normal. Endoscope was introduced and passed through a rather spastic tortuous sigmoid colon with multiple diverticula seen all the way through transverse colon where about 1 cm x 1 cm sessile polyp was seen. It was biopsied and then in piecemeal fashion removed using snare polypectomy after base was infiltrated with epinephrine. Pedunculated polyp next to it was hard to see and there was a lot of peristalsis. The scope then was advanced through rest of the transverse colon to ascending colon and cecum. Terminal ileum was briefly reviewed, appeared normal and so did cecum after copious amount of fecal material was irrigated out. Ascending colon was unremarkable. At hepatic flexure may be proximal transverse colon, there was a sessile polyp about 1.2 cm x 1 cm that was removed in the same manner with a biopsy taken, base infiltrated with epinephrine and at least two passes of snare polypectomy and subsequent hot biopsy cautery removed to hold polypoid tissue, which could be seen. In transverse colon on withdrawal and relaxation with epinephrine, an additional 1 mm to 2 mm sessile polyp was removed by hot biopsy. Then in the transverse colon, additional larger polyp about 1.3 cm x 1.2 cm was removed in piecemeal fashion again with epinephrine, sclerotherapy, and snare polypectomy. Subsequently pedunculated polyp in distal transverse colon near splenic flexure was removed with snare polypectomy. The rest of the splenic flexure and descending colon were unremarkable. Diverticulosis was again seen with almost constant spasm despite of glucagon. Sigmoid colon did somewhat hinder the inspection of that area. Rectum, retroflexion posterior anal canal showed internal hemorrhoids moderate to large. Excess of air insufflated was removed. The endoscope was withdrawn.PLAN: Await biopsy report. Pending biopsy report, recommendation will be made when the next colonoscopy should be done at least three years perhaps sooner besides and due to multitude of the patient's polyps."
Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: The patient is a 56-year-old female. She was referred for a screening colonoscopy. The patient has bowel movements every other day. There is no blood in the stool, no abdominal pain. She has hypertension, dyslipidemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She has had cesarean section twice in the past. Physical examination is unremarkable. There is no family history of colon cancer.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diverticulosis.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Procedure and possible complications were explained to the patient. Ample opportunity was provided to her to ask questions. Informed consent was obtained. She was placed in left lateral position. Inspection of perianal area was normal. Digital exam of the rectum was normal.Video Olympus colonoscope was introduced into the rectum. The sigmoid colon is very tortuous. The instrument was advanced to the cecum after placing the patient in a supine position. The patient was well prepared and a good examination was possible. The cecum was identified by the ileocecal valve and the appendiceal orifice. Images were taken. The instrument was then gradually withdrawn while examining the colon again in a circumferential manner. Few diverticula were encountered in the sigmoid and descending colon. Retroflex view of the rectum was unremarkable. No polyps or malignancy was identified.After obtaining images, the air was suctioned. Instrument was withdrawn from the patient. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Colonoscopy was performed to cecum and demonstrates the following:1. Mild-to-moderate diverticulosis.2. RECOMMENDATION:1. The patient was provided information on diverticulosis including dietary advice.2. She was advised repeat colonoscopy after 10 years."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prior history of neoplastic polyps.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Small rectal polyps/removed and fulgurated.PREMEDICATIONS: Prior to the colonoscopy, the patient complained of a sever headache and she was concerned that she might become ill. I asked the nurse to give her 25 mg of Demerol IV.Following the IV Demerol, she had a nausea reaction. She was then given 25 mg of Phenergan IV. Following this, her headache and nausea completely resolved. She was then given a total of 7.5 mg of Versed with adequate sedation. Rectal exam revealed no external lesions. Digital exam revealed no mass.REPORTED PROCEDURE: The P160 colonoscope was used. The scope was placed in the rectal ampulla and advanced to the cecum. Navigation through the sigmoid colon was difficult. Beginning at 30 cm was a very tight bend. With gentle maneuvering, the scope passed through and then entered the cecum. The cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, and descending colon were normal. The sigmoid colon was likewise normal. There were five very small (punctate) polyps in the rectum. One was resected using the electrocautery snare and the other four were ablated using the snare and cautery. There was no specimen because the polyps were so small. The scope was retroflexed in the rectum and no further abnormality was seen, so the scope was straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated.ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION:1. Five small polyps as described, all fulgurated.2. Otherwise unremarkable colonoscopy."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diarrhea, suspected irritable bowel.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Normal colonoscopy. PREMEDICATIONS: Versed 5 mg, Demerol 75 mg IV.REPORTED PROCEDURE: The rectal exam revealed no external lesions. The prostate was normal in size and consistency.The colonoscope was inserted into the cecum with ease. The cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum were normal. The scope was retroflexed in the rectum and no abnormality was seen, so the scope was straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated.ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION: Normal colonoscopy - no evidence of inflammatory disease, polyp, or other neoplasm. These findings are certainly consistent with irritable bowel syndrome."

The colonoscope was advanced to the cecum as identified by the ileocecal valve, appendiceal orifice, and blind pouch. The colonoscope was slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the colonic mucosa was made, including a retroflexed view of the rectum. There was a 4 mm descending colon polyp, which was removed with jumbo forceps, and sent for histology in bottle one. There was a 10 mm pale, flat polyp in the distal rectum, which was removed with jumbo forceps, and sent for histology in bottle 2. There were small internal hemorrhoids. The remainder of the examination was normal to the cecum. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.IMPRESSION:1. Two colon polyps, removed.2. Small internal hemorrhoids.3. Otherwise normal examination to cecum.PLAN: I will await the results of the colon polyp histology. The patient was told the importance of daily fiber."
Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Colonoscopy.INDICATIONS: Renewed symptoms likely consistent with active flare of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, not responsive to conventional therapy including sulfasalazine, cortisone, local therapy.PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure with special attention to benefits, risks, alternatives. Risks explained as bleeding, infection, bowel perforation, aspiration pneumonia, or reaction to the medications. Vital signs were monitored by blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. Supplemental O2 given. Specifics discussed. Preprocedure physical exam performed. Stable vital signs. Lungs clear. Cardiac exam showed regular rhythm. Abdomen soft. Her past history, her past workup, her past visitation with me for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, well responsive to sulfasalazine reviewed. She currently has a flare and is not responding, therefore, likely may require steroid taper. At the same token, her symptoms are mild. She has rectal bleeding, essentially only some rusty stools. There is not significant diarrhea, just some lower stools. No significant pain. Therefore, it is possible that we are just dealing with a hemorrhoidal bleed, therefore, colonoscopy now needed. Past history reviewed. Specifics of workup, need for followup, and similar discussed. All questions answered.A normal digital rectal examination was performed. The PCF-160 AL was inserted into the anus and advanced to the cecum without difficulty, as identified by the ileocecal valve, cecal stump, and appendical orifice. All mucosal aspects thoroughly inspected, including a retroflexed examination. Withdrawal time was greater than six minutes. Unfortunately, the terminal ileum could not be intubated despite multiple attempts.Findings were those of a normal cecum, right colon, transverse colon, descending colon. A small cecal polyp was noted, this was biopsy-removed, placed in bottle #1. Random biopsies from the cecum obtained, bottle #2; random biopsies from the transverse colon obtained, as well as descending colon obtained, bottle #3. There was an area of inflammation in the proximal sigmoid colon, which was biopsied, placed in bottle #4. There was an area of relative sparing, with normal sigmoid lining, placed in bottle #5, randomly biopsied, and then inflammation again in the distal sigmoid colon and rectum biopsied, bottle #6, suggesting that we may be dealing with Crohn disease, given the relative sparing of the sigmoid colon and junk lesion. Retroflexed showed hemorrhoidal disease. Scope was then withdrawn, patient left in good condition. IMPRESSION: Active flare of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, question of Crohn disease.PLAN: I will have the patient follow up with me, will follow up on histology, follow up on the polyps. She will be put on a steroid taper and make an appointment and hopefully steroids alone will do the job. If not, she may be started on immune suppressive medication, such as azathioprine, or similar. All of this has been reviewed with the patient. All questions answered."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prior history of polyps.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Small polyps, no evidence of residual or recurrent polyp in the cecum.PREMEDICATIONS: Versed 5 mg, Demerol 100 mg IV.REPORTED PROCEDURE: The rectal chamber revealed no external lesions. Prostate was normal in size and consistency.The colonoscope was inserted into the rectal ampulla and advanced under direct vision at all times until the tip of the scope was placed in the cecum. The position of the scope within the cecum was verified by identification of the ileocecal valve. Navigation was difficult because it seemed that the cecum took an upward turn at its final turn, but the examination was completed.The cecum was extensively studied and no lesion was seen. There was not even a scar representing the prior polyp. I was able to see the area across from the ileocecal valve exactly where the polyp was two years ago, and I saw no lesion at all. The scope was then slowly withdrawn. In the mid transverse colon, was a small submucosal lesion, which appeared to be a lipoma. It was freely mobile and very small with normal overlying mucosa. There was a similar lesion in the descending colon. Both of these appeared to be lipomatous, so no attempt was made to remove them. There were diverticula present in the sigmoid colon. In addition, there were two polyps in the sigmoid colon both of which were resected using electrocautery. There was no bleeding. The scope was then withdrawn. The rectum was normal. When the scope was retroflexed in the rectum, two very small polyps were noted just at the anorectal margin, and so these were obliterated using the electrocautery snare. There was no specimen and there was no bleeding. The scope was then straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated.ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION:1. Small polyps, sigmoid colon, resected them.2. Diverticulosis, sigmoid colon.3. Small rectal polyps, obliterated them.4. Submucosal lesions, consistent with lipomata as described.5. No evidence of residual or recurrent neoplasm in the cecum."
Gastroenterology,"(Medical Transcription Sample Report)PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Hematochezia.2. Refractory dyspepsia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Colonic polyps at 35 cm and 15 cm.2. Diverticulosis coli.2. Acute and chronic gastritis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:1. Colonoscopy to cecum with snare polypectomy.2. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies.INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURES: This is a 43-year-old white male who presents as an outpatient to the General Surgery Service with hematochezia with no explainable source at the anal verge. He also had refractory dyspepsia despite b.i.d., Nexium therapy. The patient does use alcohol and tobacco. The patient gave informed consent for the procedure.GROSS FINDINGS: At the time of colonoscopy, the entire length of colon was visualized. The patient was found to have a sigmoid diverticulosis. He also was found to have some colonic polyps at 35 cm and 15 cm. The polyps were large enough to be treated with snare cautery technique. The polyps were achieved and submitted to pathology. EGD did confirm acute and chronic gastritis. The biopsies were performed for H&E and CLO testing. The patient had no evidence of distal esophagitis or ulcers. No mass lesions were seen.PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the Endoscopy Suite with the heart and lungs examination unremarkable. The vital signs were monitored and found to be stable throughout the procedure. The patient was placed in the left lateral position where intravenous Demerol and Versed were given in a titrated fashion.The video Olympus colonoscope was advanced per anus and without difficulty to the level of cecum. Photographic documentation of the diverticulosis and polyps were obtained. The patient's polyps were removed in a similar fashion, each removed with snare cautery. The polyps were encircled at their stalk. Increasing the tension and cautery was applied as coagulation and cutting blunt mode, 15/15 was utilized. Good blanching was seen. The polyp was retrieved with the suction port of the scope. The patient was re-scoped to the polyp levels to confirm that there was no evidence of perforation or bleeding at the polypectomy site. Diverticulosis coli was also noted. With colonoscopy completed, the patient was then turned for EGD. The oropharynx was previously anesthetized with Cetacaine spray and a biteblock was placed. Video Olympus GIF gastroscope model was inserted per os and advanced without difficulty through the hypopharynx. The esophagus revealed a GE junction at 39 cm. The GE junction was grossly within normal limits. The stomach was entered and distended with air. Acute and chronic gastritis features as stated were appreciated. The pylorus was traversed with normal duodenum. The stomach was again reentered. Retroflex maneuver of the scope confirmed that there was no evidence of hiatal hernia. There were no ulcers or mass lesions seen. The patient had biopsy performed of the antrum for H&E and CLO testing. There was no evidence of untoward bleeding at biopsy sites. Insufflated air was removed with withdrawal of the scope. The patient will be placed on a reflux diet, given instruction and information on Nexium usage. Additional recommendations will follow pending biopsy results. He is to also abstain from alcohol and tobacco. He will require follow-up colonoscopy again in three years for polyp disease."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: History of colitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Small left colon polyp.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Total colonoscopy and polypectomy.ANESTHESIA: IV Versed 8 mg and 175 mcg of IV fentanyl.CLINICAL HISTORY: This patient had a tough time with colitis 10 years ago and has intermittent problems with bleeding. He has been admitted to the hospital now for colonoscopy and polyp surveillance.PROCEDURE: The patient was prepped and draped in a left lateral decubitus position. The flexible 165 cm CF video Olympus colonoscope was inserted through the anus and passed under TV-directed monitor through the area of the rectum, sigmoid colon, left colon, transverse colon, right colon, and cecum. He had an excellent prep. He had a 2-3 mm polyp in the left colon that was removed with a jumbo biopsy forceps. He tolerated the procedure well. There was no other evidence of any cancer, growth, tumor, colitis, or problems throughout the entire colon. His exam that he had in 1997 showed a small amount of colitis at that time and he has had some intermittent symptoms since. Representative pictures were taken throughout the entire exam. There was no other evidence any problems. On withdrawal of the scope, the same findings were noted.FINAL IMPRESSION: Small, left colon polyp in a patient with intermittent colitis-like symptoms and bleeding."
Gastroenterology,"PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Colon cancer screening.POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Colon polyps, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy, conscious sedation, and snare polypectomy. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 63-year-old male who has myelodysplastic syndrome, who was referred for colonoscopy. He has had previous colonoscopy. There is no family history of bleeding, no current problems with his bowels. On examination, he has internal hemorrhoids. His prostate is enlarged and increased somewhat in firmness. He has scattered diverticular disease of a moderate degree and he has two polyps, one 1 cm in the mid ascending colon, and one in the left transverse colon, which is also 1 cm. These were removed with snare polypectomy technique. I would recommend that the patient have an increased fiber diet and repeat colonoscopy in 5 years or sooner if he develops bowel habit change or bleeding.PROCEDURE: After explaining the operative procedure, the risks and potential complications of bleeding and perforation, the patient was given 175 mcg fentanyl, and 8 mg Versed intravenously for conscious sedation. Blood pressure 115/60, pulse 98, respiration 18, and saturation 92%. A rectal examination was done and then the colonoscope was inserted through the anorectum, rectosigmoid, descending, transverse, and ascending colon, to the ileocecal valve. The scope was withdrawn to the mid ascending colon, where the polyp was encircled with a snare and removed with a mixture of cutting and coagulating current, then retrieved through the suction port. The scope was withdrawn into the left transverse colon, where the second polyp was identified. It was encircled with a snare and removed with a mixture of cutting and coagulating current, and then removed through the suction port as well. The scope was then gradually withdrawn the remaining distance and removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Alternating hard and soft stools.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:Sigmoid diverticulosis.Sessile polyp of the sigmoid colon.Pedunculated polyp of the sigmoid colon.PROCEDURE: Total colonoscopy with biopsy and snare polypectomy.PREP: 4/4.DIFFICULTY: 1/4.PREMEDICATION AND SEDATION: Fentanyl 100, midazolam 5.INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: A 64-year-old male who has developed alternating hard and soft stools. He has one bowel movement a day.FINDINGS: There is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of inflammation or bleeding. There was a small, sessile polyp in the sigmoid colon, and a larger pedunculated polyp in the sigmoid colon, both appeared adenomatous.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Preoperative counseling, including an explicit discussion of the risk and treatment of perforation was provided. Preoperative physical examination was performed. Informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Premedications were given slowly by intravenous push. Rectal examination was performed, which was normal. The scope was introduced and passed with minimal difficulty to the cecum. This was verified anatomically and video photographs were taken of the ileocecal valve and appendiceal orifice. The scope was slowly withdrawn, the mucosa carefully visualized. It was normal in its entirety until reaching the sigmoid colon. Sigmoid colon had extensive diverticular disease, small-mouth, without inflammation or bleeding. In addition, there was a small sessile polyp, which was cold biopsied and recovered, and approximately an 8 mm pedunculated polyp. A snare was placed on the stalk of the polyp and divided with electrocautery. The polyp was recovered and sent for pathologic examination. Examination of the stalk showed good hemostasis. The scope was slowly withdrawn and the remainder of the examination was normal.ASSESSMENT: Diverticular disease. A diverticular disease handout was given to the patient's wife and a high fiber diet was recommended. In addition, 2 polyps, one of which is assuredly an adenoma. Patient needs a repeat colonoscopy in 3 years."
Gastroenterology,"The patient was placed in left lateral decubitus position and the above medications were administered. The colonoscope was advanced to the cecum, as identified by the ileocecal valve, appendiceal orifice, and blind pouch. The colonoscope was slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the colonic mucosa was made, including a retroflexed view of the rectum. The remainder of the examination was normal to the cecum. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication."
Gastroenterology,"The tip of the endoscope was inserted in the rectum. Retroflexion of the tip of the endoscope failed to reveal any distal rectal lesions. The rest of the colon, through to the cecum, was well visualized. The cecal strap and ileocecal valve were both identified. There was no evidence of tumor, polyp, mass, ulceration, or other focus of inflammation. Adverse reactions none."
Gastroenterology,"The patient was brought to the endoscopy suite, where they were placed in left lateral Sims position and underwent IV sedation. Digital rectal examination was performed, which showed no masses. The colonoscope was placed in the rectum and advanced under direct vision to the cecum. The remainder of the colonoscopy was normal. On withdrawal of the scope, there was no evidence of any mass, lesions, mucosal abnormalities, friability, or polyps. The patient was then awakened and taken from the endoscopy suite in stable condition."
Gastroenterology,"Informed consent was obtained from the patient after the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained. The risks that were explained were bleeding, infection, perforation, and allergic reaction to the medications, as well as the possibility of missing small polyps within the colon. Conscious sedation was achieved with the patient lying in the left lateral decubitus position.A colonoscope was then passed through the rectum, all the way toward the cecum, which was identified by the presence of the appendiceal orifice and ileocecal valve. This was done without difficulty and the bowel preparation was good. The ileocecal valve was intubated and the distal 2 to 3 cm of terminal ileum was inspected and was normal. The colonoscope was then slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the mucosa was performed.COMPLICATIONS: None."
Gastroenterology,"The patient was identified. Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient. The patient understood, was consented, brought in the procedure room, and connected to the appropriate monitoring devices. Versed and fentanyl were given in divided doses. After appropriate sedation was achieved, a digital rectal examination was done and was normal. A well-lubricated colonoscope was then inserted and advanced under direct visualization to the level of the cecum. A picture was taken at the level of the cecum and the colonoscope was then slowly withdrawn. After the procedure was done, the colonoscope was removed, and the patient was returned to the recovery room in stable condition. There were no complications."
Gastroenterology,"INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: A 79-year-old Filipino woman referred for colonoscopy secondary to heme-positive stools. Procedure done to rule out generalized diverticular change, colitis, and neoplasia.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was explained the procedure in detail, possible complications including infection, perforation, adverse reaction of medication, and bleeding. Informed consent was signed by the patient.With the patient in left decubitus position, had received a cumulative dose of 4 mg of Versed and 75 mg of Demerol, using Olympus video colonoscope under direct visualization was advanced to the cecum. Photodocumentation of appendiceal orifice and the ileocecal valve obtained. Cecum was slightly obscured with stool but the colon itself was adequately prepped. There was no evidence of overt colitis, telangiectasia, or overt neoplasia. There was moderately severe diverticular change, which was present throughout the colon and photodocumented. The rectal mucosa was normal and retroflexed with mild internal hemorrhoids. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.IMPRESSION:1. Colonoscopy to the cecum with adequate preparation.2. Long tortuous spastic colon.3. Moderately severe diverticular changes present throughout.4. Mild internal hemorrhoids.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Clear liquid diet today.2. Follow up with primary care physician as scheduled from time to time.3. Increase fiber in diet, strongly consider fiber supplementation."
Gastroenterology,"PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Change in bowel function.POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Proctosigmoiditis.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy with biopsy.ANESTHESIA: IV sedation.POSTPROCEDURE CONDITION: Stable. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 33-year-old with a recent change in bowel function and hematochezia. He is here for colonoscopy. He understands the risks and wishes to proceed. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the endoscopy suite where he was placed in left lateral Sims position, underwent IV sedation. Digital rectal examination was performed, which showed no masses, and a boggy prostate. The colonoscope was placed in the rectum and advanced, under direct vision, to the cecum. In the rectum and sigmoid, there were ulcerations, edema, mucosal abnormalities, and loss of vascular pattern consistent with proctosigmoiditis. Multiple random biopsies were taken of the left and right colon to see if this was in fact pan colitis.RECOMMENDATIONS: Follow up with me in 2 weeks and we will begin Canasa suppositories."
Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy and biopsy.INDICATIONS: The patient is a 50-year-old female who has had a history of a nonspecific colitis, who was admitted 3 months ago at Hospital because of severe right-sided abdominal pains, was found to have multiple ulcers within the right colon, and was then readmitted approximately 2 weeks later because of a cecal volvulus, and had a right hemicolectomy. Since then, she has had persistent right abdominal pains, as well as diarrhea, with up to 2-4 bowel movements per day. She has had problems with recurrent seizures and has been seen by Dr. XYZ, who started her recently on methadone.MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl 200 mcg, Versed 10 mg, Phenergan 25 mg intravenously given throughout the procedure.INSTRUMENT: PCF-160L.PROCEDURE REPORT: Informed consent was obtained from the patient, after the risks and benefits of the procedure were carefully explained, which included but were not limited to bleeding, infection, perforation, and allergic reaction to the medications, as well as the possibility of missing polyps within the colon.A colonoscope was then passed through the rectum, all the way toward the ileal colonic anastomosis, seen within the proximal transverse colon. The distal ileum was examined, which was normal in appearance. Random biopsies were obtained from the ileum and placed in jar #1. Random biopsies were obtained from the normal-appearing colon and placed in jar #2. Small internal hemorrhoids were noted within the rectum on retroflexion.COMPLICATIONS: None.ASSESSMENT:1. Small internal hemorrhoids.2. Ileal colonic anastomosis seen in the proximal transverse colon.3. Otherwise normal colonoscopy and ileum examination.PLAN: Followup results of biopsies. If the biopsies are unremarkable, the patient may benefit from a trial of tricyclic antidepressants, if it's okay with Dr. XYZ, for treatment of her chronic abdominal pains."
Gastroenterology,"PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever.POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Pending pathology.PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Colonoscopy with multiple biopsies, including terminal ileum, cecum, hepatic flexure, and sigmoid colon. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 28-year-old female with history of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever. Colonoscopy is indicated to evaluate for etiology.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the endoscopy suite with IV fluids being administered. She was given a total of 300 mcg of fentanyl and 15 mg of Versed, titrated for conscious IV sedation. Her heart rate, heart rhythm, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored throughout the procedure. She remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. The procedure began with a digital rectal examination. The scope was then placed through the anus and advanced without difficulty to the terminal ileum. There was what appeared to be some inflammation of the terminal ileum. This was biopsied. The scope was then withdrawn into the cecum, where biopsies were obtained. The scope was then slowly withdrawn throughout the entire length of the colon. The prep was adequate, but multiple syringes of irrigation were necessary to irrigate out some of the residual stool and allow for better visualization of the colonic mucosa. There was an area of induration and inflammation at the hepatic flexure. This was biopsied. The scope was again withdrawn throughout the length of the colon. There was also some area of inflammation in the sigmoid colon with narrowing. Again, these findings were seen on the way in with the colonoscope and were not due to scope trauma or the procedure itself. Further biopsies were obtained of the sigmoid colon in this area of narrowing. Total biopsies included terminal ileum, cecum, hepatic flexure, and sigmoid colon. The scope was then withdrawn into the rectum. Retroflexion showed a normal-appearing anal canal with no internal hemorrhoids or fissures. Other than the areas of inflammation, there were no other abnormalities identified, no AV malformations, no polyps, no diverticulum. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate postprocedure complications."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea. OPERATION PERFORMED: Colonoscopy with random biopsies and culture.INDICATIONS: The patient is a 50-year-old woman who underwent hemorrhoidectomy approximately one year ago. She has been having difficulty since that time with intermittent diarrhea and abdominal pain. She states this happens quite frequently and can even happen when she uses topical prednisone for her ears or for her eyes. She presents today for screening colonoscopy, based on the same.OPERATIVE COURSE: The risks and benefits of colonoscopy were explained to the patient in detail. She provided her consent. The morning of the operation, the patient was transported from the preoperative holding area to the endoscopy suite. She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. In divided doses, she was given 7 mg of Versed and 125 mcg of fentanyl. A digital rectal examination was performed, after which time the scope was intubated from the anus to the level of the hepatic flexure. This was intubated fairly easily; however, the patient was clearly in some discomfort and was shouting out, despite the amount of anesthesia she was provided. In truth, the pain she was experiencing was out of proportion to any maneuver or difficulty with the procedure. While more medication could have been given, the patient is actually a fairly thin woman and diminutive and I was concerned that giving her any more sedation may lead to respiratory or cardiovascular collapse. In addition, she was really having quite some difficulty staying still throughout the procedure and was putting us all at some risk. For this reason, the procedure was aborted at the level of the hepatic flexure. She was noted to have some pools of stool. This was suctioned and sent to pathology for C difficile, ova and parasites, and fecal leukocytes. Additionally, random biopsies were performed of the colon itself. It is unfortunate we were unable to complete this procedure, as I would have liked to have taken biopsies of the terminal ileum. However, given the degree of discomfort she had, again, coupled with the relative ease of the procedure itself, I am very suspicious of irritable bowel syndrome. The patient tolerated the remainder of the procedure fairly well and was sent to the recovery room in stable condition, where it is anticipated she will be discharged to home.PLAN: She needs to follow up with me in approximately 2 weeks' time, both to follow up with her biopsies and cultures. She has been given a prescription for VSL3, a probiotic, to assist with reculturing the rectum. She may also benefit from an antispasmodic and/or anxiolytic. Lastly, it should be noted that when she next undergoes endoscopic procedure, propofol would be indicated."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Blood loss anemia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Diverticulosis coli.2. Internal hemorrhoids.3. Poor prep.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy with photos.ANESTHESIA: Conscious sedation per Anesthesia.SPECIMENS: None.HISTORY: The patient is an 85-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with a markedly decreased hemoglobin and blood loss anemia. She underwent an EGD and attempted colonoscopy; however, due to a very poor prep, only a flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed at that time. A coloscopy is now being performed for completion.PROCEDURE: After proper informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the Endoscopy Suite. She was placed in the left lateral position and was given sedation by the Anesthesia Department. A digital rectal exam was performed and there was no evidence of mass. The colonoscope was then inserted into the rectum. There was some solid stool encountered. The scope was maneuvered around this. There was relatively poor prep as the scope was advanced through the sigmoid colon and portions of the descending colon. The scope was then passed through the transverse colon and ascending colon to the cecum. No masses or polyps were noted. Visualization of the portions of the colon was however somewhat limited. There were scattered diverticuli noted in the sigmoid.The scope was slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls. Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed and nonsurgical internal hemorrhoids were noted. The scope was then completely withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition. She will be placed on a high-fiber diet and Colace and we will continue to monitor her hemoglobin."
Gastroenterology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Colostomy failure. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient had a colostomy placed 9 days ago after resection of colonic carcinoma. Earlier today, he felt nauseated and stated that his colostomy stopped filling. He also had a sensation of """"heartburn."""" He denies vomiting but has been nauseated. He denies diarrhea. He denies hematochezia, hematemesis, or melena. He denies frank abdominal pain or fever. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above. Also, hypertension. ALLERGIES: """"Fleet enema."""" MEDICATIONS: Accupril and vitamins. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:SYSTEMIC: The patient denies fever or chills.HEENT: The patient denies blurred vision, headache, or change in hearing.NECK: The patient denies dysphagia, dysphonia, or neck pain.RESPIRATORY: The patient denies shortness of breath, cough, or hemoptysis.CARDIAC: The patient denies history of arrhythmia, swelling of the extremities, palpitations, or chest pain.GASTROINTESTINAL: See above.MUSCULOSKELETAL: The patient denies arthritis, arthralgias, or joint swelling.NEUROLOGIC: The patient denies difficulty with balance, numbness, or paralysis.GENITOURINARY: The patient denies dysuria, flank pain, or hematuria.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 183/108, pulse 76, respirations 16, temperature 98.7. HEENT: Cranial nerves are grossly intact. There is no scleral icterus. NECK: No jugular venous distention. CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended. Bowel sounds are decreased and high-pitched. There is a large midline laparotomy scar with staples still in place. There is no evidence of wound infection. Examination of the colostomy port reveals no obvious fecal impaction or site of obstruction. There is no evidence of infection. The mucosa appears normal. There is a small amount of nonbloody stool in the colostomy bag. There are no masses or bruits noted. EXTREMITIES: There is no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. Pulses are 2+ and equal bilaterally. NEUROLOGIC: The patient is alert and awake with no focal motor or sensory deficit noted. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING: Failure of colostomy to function may repre- sent an impaction; however, I did not appreciate this on physical examination. There may also be an adhesion or proximal impaction which I cannot reach, which may cause a bowel obstruction, failure of the shunt, nausea, and ultimately vomiting. An abdominal series was obtained, which confirmed this possibility by demonstrating air-fluid levels and dilated bowel. The CBC showed WBC of 9.4 with normal differential. Hematocrit is 42.6. I interpret this as normal. Amylase is currently pending. I have discussed this case with Dr. S, the patient's surgeon, who agrees that there is a possibility of bowel obstruction and the patient should be admitted to observation. Because of the patient's insurance status, the patient will actually be admitted to Dr. D on observation. I have discussed the case with Dr. P, who is the doctor on call for Dr. D. Both Dr. S and Dr. P have been informed of the patient's condition and are aware of his situation. FINAL IMPRESSION: Bowel obstruction, status post colostomy. DISPOSITION: Admission to observation. The patient's condition is good. He is hemodynamically stable."

Father is alive, but unknown medical history as they have been estranged. She has a 51-year-old sister with history of multiple colon polyps. She has 2 brothers, 1 of whom has schizophrenia, but she knows very little about their medical history. To the best of her knowledge, there are no family members with stomach cancer or colon cancer.SOCIAL HISTORY: She was born in Houston, Texas and moved to Florida about 3 years ago. She is divorced. She has worked as a travel agent. She has 2 sons ages 24 and 26, both of whom are alive and well. She smokes a half a pack of cigarettes per day for more than 35 years.

Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis, and/or edema. Skin is warm and dry. Rectal was deferred and will be done at the time of the colonoscopy.IMPRESSION:1. A 50-year-old female whose 51-year-old sister has a history of multiple colon polyps, which may slightly increase her risk for colon cancer in the future.2. Reports of recurrent bright red blood per rectum, mostly on the toilet paper over the past year. Bleeding most likely consistent with internal hemorrhoids; however, she needs further evaluation for colon polyps or colon cancer.3. Alternations between constipation and diarrhea for the past several years with some lower abdominal cramping and discomfort particularly associated with constipation. She is on multiple medications including narcotics and may have developed narcotic bowel syndrome.4. A long history of pyrosis, dyspepsia, nausea, and belching for many years relieved by antacids. She may likely have underlying gastroesophageal reflux disease.5. A 1-year history of some early satiety and fluctuations in her weight up and down 4 pounds. She may also have some GI dysmotility including gastroparesis.6. Report of dysphagia to solids over the past several years with a history of a bone spur in her cervical spine. If this bone spur is pressing anteriorly, it could certainly cause recurrent symptoms of dysphagia. Differential also includes peptic stricture or Schatzki's ring, and even remotely, the possibility of an esophageal malignancy.7. A history of infectious hepatitis in the past with some recent mild elevations in AST and ALT levels without clear etiology. She may have some reaction to her multiple medications including her statin drugs, which can cause mild elevations in transaminases. She may have some underlying fatty liver disease and differential could include some form of viral hepatitis such as hepatitis B or even C.PLAN:1. We have asked her to follow up with her primary care physician with regard to this recent elevation in her transaminases. She will likely have the lab tests repeated in the future, and if they remain persistently elevated, we will be happy to see her in the future for further evaluation if her primary care physician would like.2. Discussed reflux precautions and gave literature for further review.3. Schedule an upper endoscopy with possible esophageal dilatation, as well as colonoscopy with possible infrared coagulation of suspected internal hemorrhoids. Both procedures were explained in detail including risks and complications such as adverse reaction to medication, as well as respiratory embarrassment, infection, bleeding, perforation, and possibility of missing a small polyp or tumor.4. Alternatives including upper GI series, flexible sigmoidoscopy, barium enema, and CT colonography were discussed; however, the patient agrees to proceed with the plan as outlined above.5. Due to her sister's history of colon polyps, she will likely be advised to have a repeat colonoscopy in 5 years or perhaps sooner pending the results of her baseline examination."
Gastroenterology,"PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a very pleasant 69-year-old Caucasian male whom we are asked to see primarily because of a family history of colon cancer, but the patient also has rectal bleeding on a weekly basis and also heartburn once every 1 or 2 weeks. The patient states that he had his first colonoscopy 6 years ago and it was negative. His mother was diagnosed with colon cancer probably in her 50s, but she died of cancer of the esophagus at age 86. The patient does have hemorrhoidal bleed about once a week. Otherwise, he denies any change in bowel habits, abdominal pain, or weight loss. He gets heartburn mainly with certain food such as raw onions and he has had it for years. It will typically occur every couple of weeks. He has had no dysphagia. He has never had an upper endoscopy.MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for hypertension, adult-onset diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and restless legs syndrome.SURGICAL HISTORY: Appendectomy as a child and cholecystectomy in 2003.MEDICATIONS: His medications are lisinopril 40 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily, metformin 1000 mg twice a day, Januvia 100 mg daily, clonazepam 10 mg at bedtime for restless legs syndrome, Crestor 10 mg nightly, and Flomax 0.4 mg daily.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is retired. He is married. He had 4 children. He quite smoking 25 years ago after a 35-year history of smoking. He does not drink alcohol.FAMILY HISTORY: Mother had colon cancer in her 50s, esophageal cancer in her 80s. Her mother smoked and drank. Father got a mesothelioma at age 65. There is a brother of 65 with hypertension.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He has had prostatitis with benign prostatic hypertrophy. He has some increased urinary frequency from a history of prostatitis. He has the heartburn, which is diet dependent and the frequent rectal bleeding. He also has restless legs syndrome at night. No cardio or pulmonary complaints. No weight loss.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Reveals a well-developed, well-nourished man in no acute distress. BP 112/70. Pulse 80 and regular. Respirations non-labored. Height 5 feet 7-1/2 inches. Weight 209 pounds. HEENT exam: Sclerae are anicteric. Pupils equal, conjunctivae clear. No gross oropharyngeal lesions. Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, or JVD. Lungs are clear to percussion and auscultation. Heart sounds are regular without murmur, gallop, or rub. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There are no masses. There is no hepatosplenomegaly. The bowel sounds are normal. Rectal examination: Deferred. Extremities have no clubbing, cyanosis or edema. Skin is warm and dry. The patient is alert and oriented with a pleasant affect and no gross motor deficits.IMPRESSION:1. Family history of colon cancer.2. Rectal bleeding.3. Heartburn and a family history of esophageal cancer.PLAN: I agree with the indications for repeat colonoscopy, which should be done at least every 5 years. Also, discussed IRC to treat bleeding and internal hemorrhoids if he is deemed to be an appropriate candidate at the time of his colonoscopy and the patient was agreeable. I am also a little concerned about his family history of esophageal cancer and his personal history of heartburn and suggested that we check him once for Barrett's esophagus. If he does not have it now then it should not be a significant risk in the future. The indications and benefits of EGD, colonoscopy, and IRC were discussed. The risks including sedation, bleeding, infection, and perforation were discussed. The importance of a good bowel prep so as to minimize missing any lesions was discussed. His questions were answered and informed consent obtained. It was a pleasure to care for this nice patient."
Gastroenterology,"HISTORY: A is a 55-year-old who I know well because I have been taking care of her husband. She comes for discussion of a screening colonoscopy. Her last colonoscopy was in 2002, and at that time she was told it was essentially normal. Nonetheless, she has a strong family history of colon cancer, and it has been almost four to five years so she wants to have a repeat colonoscopy. I told her that the interval was appropriate and that it made sense to do so. She denies any significant weight change that she cannot explain. She has had no hematochezia. She denies any melena. She says she has had no real change in her bowel habit but occasionally does have thin stools.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: On today's visit we reviewed her entire health history. Surgically she has had a stomach operation for ulcer disease back in 1974, she says. She does not know exactly what was done. It was done at a hospital in California which she says no longer exists. This makes it difficult to find out exactly what she had done. She also had her gallbladder and appendix taken out in the 1970s at the same hospital. Medically she has no significant problems and no true medical illnesses. She does suffer from some mild gastroparesis, she says.MEDICATIONS: Reglan 10 mg once a day.ALLERGIES: She denies any allergies to medications but is sensitive to medications that cause her to have ulcers, she says.SOCIAL HISTORY: She still smokes one pack of cigarettes a day. She was counseled to quit. She occasionally uses alcohol. She has never used illicit drugs. She is married, is a housewife, and has four children.FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for diabetes and cancer.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Essentially as mentioned above.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: A is a healthy appearing female in no apparent distress.VITAL SIGNS: Her vital signs reveal a weight of 164 pounds, blood pressure 140/90, temperature of 97.6 degrees F.HEENT: No cervical bruits, thyromegaly, or masses. She has no lymphadenopathy in the head and neck, supraclavicular, or axillary spaces bilaterally.LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rubs, or rhonchi.HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub, or gallop.ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended.EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema, with good pulses in the radial arteries bilaterally.NEURO: No focal deficits, is intact to soft touch in all four.ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: In light of her history and physical, clearly the patient would be well served with an upper and lower endoscopy. We do not know what the anatomy is, and if she did have an antrectomy, she needs to be checked for marginal ulcers. She also complains of significant reflux and has not had an upper endoscopy in over five to six years as well. I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternatives to upper and lower endoscopy, and these include over sedation, perforation, and dehydration, and she wants to proceed.We will schedule her for an upper and lower endoscopy at her convenience."
Gastroenterology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: """"I want my colostomy reversed.""""HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. A is a pleasant 43-year-old African-American male who presents to our clinic for a colostomy reversal as well as repair of an incisional hernia. The patient states that in November 2007, he presented to High Point Regional Hospital with sharp left lower quadrant pain and was emergently taken to Surgery where he woke up with a """"bag."""" According to some notes that were faxed to our office from the surgeon in High Point who performed his initial surgery, Dr. X, the patient had diverticulitis with perforated sigmoid colon, and underwent a sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch. The patient was unaware of his diagnosis; therefore, we discussed that with him today in clinic. The patient also complains of the development of an incisional hernia since his surgery in November. He was seen back by Dr. X in April 2008 and hopes that Dr. X may reverse his colostomy and repair his hernia since he did his initial surgery, but because the patient has lost his job and has no insurance, he was referred to our clinic by Dr. X. Currently, the patient does state that his hernia bothers him more so than his colostomy, and if it were not for the hernia then he may just refrain from having his colostomy reversed; however, the hernia has grown in size and causing him significant discomfort. He feels that he always has to hold his hand over the hernia to prevent it from prolapsing and causing him even more discomfort.PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.2.

Otherwise, there are no further hernias or masses noted.EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 43-year-old gentleman who underwent what sounds like a sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch in November of 2007 secondary to perforated colon from diverticulitis. The patient presents for reversal of his colostomy as well as repair of his incisional hernia. I have asked the patient to return to High Point Regional and get his medical records including the operative note and pathology results from his initial surgery so that I would have a better idea of what was done during his initial surgery. He stated that he would try and do this and bring the records to our clinic on his next appointment. I have also set him up for a barium enema to study the rectal stump. He will return to us in two weeks at which time we will review his radiological studies and his medical records from the outside hospital and determine the best course of action from that point. This was discussed with the patient as well as his sister and significant other in the clinic today. They were in agreement with this plan. We also called the social worker to come and help the patient get more ostomy appliances, as he stated that he had no more and he was having to reuse the existing ostomy bag. To my understanding, his social worker, as well as the ostomy nurses were able to get him some assistance with this."
Gastroenterology,"EXAM: CT Abdomen & Pelvis W&WO ContrastREASON FOR EXAM: Status post aortobiiliac graft repair. TECHNIQUE: 5 mm spiral thick spiral CT scanning was performed through the entire abdomen and pelvis utilizing intravenous dynamic bolus contrast enhancement. No oral or rectal contrast was utilized. Comparison is made with the prior CT abdomen and pelvis dated 10/20/05. There has been no significant change in size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm centered roughly at the renal artery origin level which has dimensions of 3.7 cm transversely x 3.4 AP. Just below this level is the top of the endoluminal graft repair with numerous surrounding surgical clips. The size of the native aneurysm component at this level is stable at 5.5 cm in diameter with mural thrombus surrounding the enhancing endolumen. There is no abnormal entrance of contrast agent into the mural thrombus to indicate an endoluminal leak. Further distally, there is extension of the graft into both proximal common iliac arteries without evidence for endoluminal leak at this level either. No exoluminal leakage is identified at any level. There is no retroperitoneal hematoma present. The findings are unchanged from the prior exam. The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenals and right kidney are unremarkable with moderate diffuse atrophy of the pancreas present. There is advanced atrophy of the left kidney. No hydronephrosis is present. No acute findings are identified elsewhere in the abdomen. The lung bases are clear. Concerning the remainder of the pelvis, no acute pathology is identified.

Gastroenterology,"ADMITTING DIAGNOSES: Hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease reflux.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease reflux.SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: Postoperative ileus.PROCEDURES DONE: Hiatal hernia repair and Nissen fundoplication revision.BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is an 18-year-old male who has had a history of a Nissen fundoplication performed six years ago for gastric reflux. Approximately one year ago, he was involved in a motor vehicle accident and CT scan at that time showed that he had a hiatal hernia. Over the past year, this has caused him an increasing number of problems, including chest pain when he eats, and shortness of breath after large meals. He is also having reflux symptoms again. He presents to us for repair of the hiatal hernia and revision of the Nissen fundoplication.HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. A was admitted to the adolescent floor by Brenner Children's Hospital after his procedure. He was stable at that time. He did complain of some nausea. However, he did not have any vomiting at that time. He had an NG tube in and was n.p.o. He also had a PCA for pain management as well as Toradol. On postoperative day #1, he complained of not being able to urinate, so a Foley catheter was placed. Over the next several days, his hospital course proceeded as follows. He continued to complain of some nausea; however, he did not ever have any vomiting. Eventually, the Foley catheter was discontinued and he had excellent urine output without any complications. He ambulated frequently. He remained n.p.o. for three days. He also had the NG tube in during that time. On postoperative day #4, he began to have some flatus, and the NG tube was discontinued. He was advanced to a liquid diet and tolerated this without any complications. At this time, he was still using the PCA for pain control. However, he was using it much less frequently than on days #1 and #2 postoperatively. After tolerating the full liquid diet without any complications, he was advanced to a soft diet and his pain medications were transitioned to p.o. medications rather than the PCA. The PCA was discontinued. He tolerated the soft diet without any complications and continued to have flatus frequently. On postoperative day #6, it was determined that he was stable for discharge to home as he was taking p.o. without any complications. His pain was well controlled with p.o. pain medications. He was passing gas frequently, had excellent urine output, and was ambulating frequently without any issues.DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.DISPOSITION: Discharged to home.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was discharged to home with instructions for maintaining a soft diet. It was also recommended that he does not drink any soda postoperatively. He is instructed to keep his incision site clean and dry and it was also recommended that he avoid any heavy lifting. He will be able to attend school when it starts in a few weeks. However, he is not going to be able to play football in the near future. He was given prescription for pain medication upon discharge. He is instructed to contact Pediatric Surgery if he has any fevers, any nausea and vomiting, any chest pain, any constipation, or any other concerns."

She was afebrile. She was taken by Dr. X to the operating room.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent a procedure. She tolerated without difficulty. She had her pain controlled with p.o. pain medicine. She was afebrile. She is tolerating liquid diet. It was felt that the patient is stable for discharge. She did complain of bladder spasms when she urinated and she did say that she has a history of chronic UTIs. We will check a UA and urine culture prior to discharge. I will give her prescription for ciprofloxacin that she can take for 3 days presumptively and I have discharged her home with omeprazole and Colace to take over-the-counter for constipation and we will send her home with Percocet for pain. Her labs were within normal limits. She did have an elevated white blood cell count, but I believe this is just leukemoid reaction, but she is afebrile, and if she does have UTI, may also be related. Her labs in terms of her bilirubin were within normal limits. Her LFTs were slightly elevated, I do believe this is related to the cautery used on the liver bed. They were 51 and 83 for the AST and ALT respectively. I feel that she looks good for discharge.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: Clear liquid diet x48 hours and she can return to her Medifast, she may shower. She needs to keep her wound clean and dry. She is not to engage in any heavy lifting greater than 10 pounds x2 weeks. No driving for 1 to 2 weeks.

Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Perforated Meckel's diverticulum.PROCEDURES PERFORMED:1. Diagnostic laparotomy.2. Exploratory laparotomy.3. Meckel's diverticulectomy.4. Open incidental appendectomy.5. Peritoneal toilet.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 300 ml.URINE OUTPUT: 200 ml.TOTAL FLUID: 1600 mL.DRAIN: JP x1 right lower quadrant and anterior to the rectum.TUBES: Include an NG and a Foley catheter.SPECIMENS: Include Meckel's diverticulum and appendix.COMPLICATIONS: Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure with hypoxemia following closure.BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 45-year-old Caucasian gentleman presented to ABCD General Hospital with acute onset of right lower quadrant pain that began 24 hours prior to this evaluation.The pain was very vague and progressed in intensity. The patient has had anorexia with decrease in appetite. His physical examination revealed the patient to be febrile with the temperature of 102.4. He had right lower quadrant and suprapubic tenderness with palpation with Rovsing sign and rebound consistent with acute surgical abdomen. The patient was presumed acute appendicitis and was placed on IV antibiotics and recommended that he undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with possible open exploratory laparotomy. He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and gave informed consent to proceed.OPERATIVE FINDINGS: Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed purulent drainage within the region of the right lower quadrant adjacent to the cecum and terminal ileum. There was large amounts of purulent drainage. The appendix was visualized, however, it was difficult to be visualized secondary to the acute inflammatory process, purulent drainage, and edema. It was decided given the signs of perforation and purulent drainage within the abdomen that we would convert to an open exploratory laparotomy. Upon exploration of the ileum, there was noted to be a ruptured Meckel's diverticulum, this was resected. Additionally, the appendix appeared normal without evidence of perforation and/or edema and a decision to proceed with incidental appendectomy was performed. The patient was irrigated with copious amounts of warmth normal saline approximately 2 to 3 liters. The patient was closed and did develop some hypoxemia after closure. He remained ventilated and was placed on a large amount of ________. His hypoxia did resolve and he remained intubated and proceed to the Critical Care Complex or postop surgical care.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position. He did receive preoperative IV antibiotics, sequential compression devices, NG tube placement with Foley catheter, and heparin subcutaneously. The patient was intubated by the Anesthesia Department. After adequate anesthesia was obtained, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution. Utilizing a #10 blade scalpel, an infraumbilical incision was created. The Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen. The abdomen was insufflated to approximately 15 mmHg. A #10 mm ablated trocar was inserted into the abdomen and a video laparoscope was inserted and the abdomen was explored and the above findings were noted. A right upper quadrant 5 mm port was inserted to help with manipulation of bowel and to visualize the appendix. Decision was then made to convert to exploratory laparotomy given the signs of acute perforation. The instruments were then removed. The abdomen was then deflated. Utilizing ________ #10 blade scalpel, a midline incision was created from the xiphoid down to level of the pubic symphysis.The incision was carried down with a #10 blade scalpel and the bleeding was controlled along the way with electrocautery. The posterior layer of the rectus fascia and peritoneum was opened carefully with the scissors as the peritoneum had already been penetrated during laparoscopy. Incision was carried down to the midline within the linea alba. Once the abdomen was opened, there was noted to be gross purulent drainage. The ileum was explored and there was noted to be a perforated Meckel's diverticulum. Decision to resect the diverticulum was performed.The blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was carefully dissected free and a #3-0 Vicryl was used to tie off the blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum. Clamps were placed to the proximal supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was tied off with #3-0 Vicryl sutures. The Meckel's diverticulum was noted to be completely free and was grasped anteriorly and utilizing a GIA stapling device, the diverticulum was transected. There was noted to be a hemostatic region within the transection and staple line looked intact without evidence of perforation and/or leakage. Next, decision was decided to go ahead and perform an appendectomy. Mesoappendix was doubly clamped with hemostats and cut with Metzenbaum scissors. The appendiceal artery was identified and was clamped between two hemostats and transected as well. Once the appendix was completely freed of the surrounding inflammation and adhesion. A plain gut was placed at the base of the appendix and tied down. The appendix was milked distally with a straight stat and clamped approximately halfway. A second piece of plain gut suture was used to ligate above and then was transected with a #10 blade scalpel. The appendiceal stump was then inverted with a pursestring suture of #2-0 Vicryl suture. Once the ________ was completed, decision to place a JP drain within the right lower quadrant was performed. The drain was positioned within the right lower quadrant and anterior to the rectum and brought out through a separate site in the anterior abdominal wall. It was sewn in place with a #3-0 nylon suture. The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of warmed normal saline. The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable for pathology. The omentum was replaced over the bowel contents and utilizing #1-0 PDS suture, the abdominal wall, anterior and posterior rectus fascias were closed with a running suture. Once the abdomen was completely closed, the subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the incision was closed with staples. The previous laparoscopic sites were also closed with staples. Sterile dressings were placed over the wound with Adaptic and 4x4s and covered with ABDs. JPs replaced with bulb suction. NG tube and Foley catheter were left in place. The patient tolerated this procedure well with exception of hypoxemia which resolved by the conclusion of the case.The patient will proceed to the Critical Care Complex where he will be closely evaluated and followed in his postoperative course. To remain on IV antibiotics and we will manage ventilatory-dependency of the patient."

Gastroenterology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly, this is a 17-year-old male, who has had problems with dysphagia to solids and recently had food impacted in the lower esophagus. He is now having upper endoscopy to evaluate the esophagus after edema and inflammation from the food impaction has resolved, to look for any stricture that may need to be dilated, or any other mucosal abnormality.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: EGD.PREP: Cetacaine spray, 100 mcg of fentanyl IV, and 5 mg of Versed IV.FINDINGS: The tip of the endoscope was introduced into the esophagus, and the entire length of the esophagus was dotted with numerous, white, punctate lesions, suggestive of eosinophilic esophagitis. There were come concentric rings present. There was no erosion or flame hemorrhage, but there was some friability in the distal esophagus. Biopsies throughout the entire length of the esophagus from 25-40 cm were obtained to look for eosinophilic esophagitis. There was no stricture or Barrett mucosa. The bony and the antrum of the stomach are normal without any acute peptic lesions. Retroflexion of the tip of the endoscope in the body of the stomach revealed a normal cardia. There were no acute lesions and no evidence of ulcer, tumor, or polyp. The pylorus was easily entered, and the first, second, and third portions of the duodenum are normal. Adverse reactions: None.FINAL IMPRESSION: Esophageal changes suggestive of eosinophilic esophagitis. Biopsies throughout the length of the esophagus were obtained for microscopic analysis. There was no evidence of stricture, Barrett, or other abnormalities in the upper GI tract."
Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy.PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Dysphagia.POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Active reflux esophagitis, distal esophageal stricture, ring due to reflux esophagitis, dilated with balloon to 18 mm.PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure with special attention to benefits, risks, alternatives. Risks explained as bleeding, infection, bowel perforation, aspiration pneumonia, or reaction to the medications. Vital signs were monitored by blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. Supplemental O2 given. Specifics of the procedure discussed. The procedure was discussed with father and mother as the patient is mentally challenged. He has no complaints of dysphagia usually for solids, better with liquids, worsening over the last 6 months, although there is an emergency department report from last year. He went to the emergency department yesterday with beef jerky.All of this reviewed. The patient is currently on Cortef, Synthroid, Tegretol, Norvasc, lisinopril, DDAVP. He is being managed for extensive past history due to an astrocytoma, brain surgery, hypothyroidism, endocrine insufficiency. He has not yet undergone significant workup. He has not yet had an endoscopy or barium study performed. He is developmentally delayed due to the surgery, panhypopituitarism.His family history is significant for his father being of mine, also having reflux issues, without true heartburn, but distal esophageal stricture. The patient does not smoke, does not drink. He is living with his parents. Since his emergency department visitation yesterday, no significant complaints.Large male, no acute distress. Vital signs monitored in the endoscopy suite. Lungs clear. Cardiac exam showed regular rhythm. Abdomen obese but soft. Extremity exam showed large hands. He was a Mallampati score A, ASA classification type 2.The procedure discussed with the patient, the patient's mother. Risks, benefits, and alternatives discussed. Potential alternatives for dysphagia, such as motility disorder, given his brain surgery, given the possibility of achalasia and similar discussed. The potential need for a barium swallow, modified barium swallow, and similar discussed. All questions answered. At this point, the patient will undergo endoscopy for evaluation of dysphagia, with potential benefit of the possibility to dilate him should there be a stricture. He may have reflux symptoms, without complaining of heartburn. He may benefit from a trial of PPI. All of this reviewed. All questions answered."

Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Blood loss anemia.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Normal colon with no evidence of bleeding.2. Hiatal hernia.3. Fundal gastritis with polyps.4. Antral mass.ANESTHESIA: Conscious sedation with Demerol and Versed.SPECIMEN: Antrum and fundal polyps.HISTORY: The patient is a 66-year-old African-American female who presented to ABCD Hospital with mental status changes. She has been anemic as well with no gross evidence of blood loss. She has had a decreased appetite with weight loss greater than 20 lb over the past few months. After discussion with the patient and her daughter, she was scheduled for EGD and colonoscopy for evaluation.PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite. She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation. When adequate level of sedation was achieved, a digital rectal exam was performed, which demonstrated no masses and no hemorrhoids. The colonoscope was inserted into the rectum and air was insufflated. The scope was coursed through the rectum and sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon to the level of the cecum. There were no polyps, masses, diverticuli, or areas of inflammation. The scope was then slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls. Air was aspirated. Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed. There was no evidence of perianal disease. No source of the anemia was identified.Attention was then taken for performing an EGD. The gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and was entered into the hypopharynx. The esophagus was easily intubated and traversed. There were no abnormalities of the esophagus. The stomach was entered and was insufflated. The scope was coursed along the greater curvature towards the antrum. Adjacent to the pylorus, towards the anterior surface, was a mass like lesion with a central _______. It was not clear if this represents a healing ulcer or neoplasm. Several biopsies were taken. The mass was soft. The pylorus was then entered. The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined. There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, or bleeding. The scope was then brought back into the antrum and was retroflexed. In the fundus and body, there was evidence of streaking and inflammation. There were also several small sessile polyps, which were removed with biopsy forceps. Biopsy was also taken for CLO. A hiatal hernia was present as well. Air was aspirated. The scope was slowly withdrawn. The GE junction was unremarkable. The scope was fully withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition. She will undergo a CAT scan of her abdomen and pelvis to further assess any possible adenopathy or gastric obstructional changes. We will await the biopsy reports and further recommendations will follow."

Extraocular movements are intact. Face is symmetric. Tongue and palate are midline. Jaw muscles strong. Cough is normal. SCM and shrug 5 and 5. Visual fields intact.MOTOR EXAM: Normal for bulk, strength, and tone. There was no drift or tremor.SENSORY EXAM: Intact for pinprick and proprioception.COORDINATION: Normal for finger-to-nose.REFLEXES: Are 2+ throughout.GAIT: Assessed using the Tinetti assessment tool. She was fairly quick, but had some unsteadiness and a widened base. She did not need an assistive device. I gave her a score of 13/16 for balance and 9/12 for gait for a total score of 22/28.REVIEW OF X-RAYS: MRI was reviewed from June 26, 2008. It shows mild ventriculomegaly with a trace expansion into the temporal horns. The frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro is 3.8 cm with a flat 3rd ventricular contour and a 3rd ventricular span of 11 mm. The sylvian aqueduct is patent. There is no pulsation artifact. Her corpus callosum is bowed and effaced. She has a couple of small T2 signal abnormalities, but no significant periventricular signal change.ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 74-year-old woman who presents with mild progressive gait impairment and possible slowing of her cognition in the setting of ventriculomegaly suggesting possible adult hydrocephalus.PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:1. Possible adult hydrocephalus (331.5).2. Mild gait impairment (781.2).3. Mild cognitive slowing (290.0).PLAN: I had a long discussion with the patient her husband.I think it is possible that the patient is developing symptomatic adult hydrocephalus. At this point, her symptoms are fairly mild. I explained to them the two methods of testing with CSF drainage. It is possible that a large volume lumbar puncture would reveal whether she is likely to respond to shunt and I described that test. About 30% of my patients with walking impairment in a setting of possible adult hydrocephalus can be diagnosed with a large volume lumbar puncture. Alternatively, I could bring her into the hospital for four days of CSF drainage to determine whether she is likely to respond to shunt surgery. This procedure carries a 2% to 3% risk of meningitis. I also explained that it would be reasonable to start with an outpatient lumbar puncture and if that is not sufficient we could proceed with admission for the spinal catheter protocol."
Neurology,"CC: Memory difficulty.HX: This 64 y/o RHM had had difficulty remembering names, phone numbers and events for 12 months prior to presentation, on 2/28/95. This had been called to his attention by the clerical staff at his parish--he was a Catholic priest. He had had no professional or social faux pas or mishaps due to his memory. He could not tell whether his problem was becoming worse, so he brought himself to the Neurology clinic on his own referral.MEDS: None.PMH: 1)appendectomy, 2)tonsillectomy, 3)childhood pneumonia, 4)allergy to sulfa drugs.FHX: Both parents experienced memory problems in their ninth decades, but not earlier. 5 siblings have had no memory trouble. There are no neurological illnesses in his family.SHX: Catholic priest. Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use.EXAM: BP131/74, HR78, RR12, 36.9C, Wt. 77kg, Ht. 178cm.MS: A&O to person, place and time. 29/30 on MMSE; 2/3 recall at 5 minutes. 2/10 word recall at 10 minutes. Unable to remember the name of the President (Clinton). 23words/60 sec on Category fluency testing (normal). Mild visual constructive deficit.The rest of the neurologic exam was unremarkable and there were no extrapyramidal signs or primitive reflexes noted.COURSE: TSH 5.1, T4 7.9, RPR non-reactive. Neuropsychological evaluation, 3/6/95, revealed: 1)well preserved intellectual functioning and orientation, 2) significant deficits in verbal and visual memory, proper naming, category fluency and working memory, 3)performances which were below expectations on tests of speed of reading, visual scanning, visual construction and clock drawing, 4)limited insight into the scope and magnitude of cognitive dysfunction. The findings indicated multiple areas of cerebral dysfunction. With the exception of the patient's report of minimal occupational dysfunction ( which may reflect poor insight), the clinical picture is consistent with a progressive dementia syndrome such as Alzheimer's disease. MRI brain, 3/6/95, showed mild generalized atrophy, more severe in the occipital-parietal regions.In 4/96, his performance on repeat neuropsychological evaluation was relatively stable. His verbal learning and delayed recognition were within normal limits, whereas delayed recall was """"moderately severely"""" impaired. Immediate and delayed visual memory were slightly below expectations. Temporal orientation and expressive language skills were below expectation, especially in word retrieval. These findings were suggestive of particular, but not exclusive, involvement of the temporal lobes.On 9/30/96, he was evaluated for a 5 minute spell of visual loss, OU. The episode occurred on Friday, 9/27/96, in the morning while sitting at his desk doing paperwork. He suddenly felt that his gaze was pulled toward a pile of letters; then a """"curtain"""" came down over both visual fields, like """"everything was in the shade."""" During the episode he felt fully alert and aware of his surroundings. He concurrently heard a """"grating sound"""" in his head. After the episode, he made several phone calls, during which he reportedly sounded confused, and perseverated about opening a bank account. He then drove to visit his sister in Muscatine, Iowa, without accident. He was reportedly """"normal"""" when he reached her house. He was able to perform Mass over the weekend without any difficulty. Neurologic examination, 9/30/96, was notable for: 1)category fluency score of 18items/60 sec. 2)VFFTC and EOM were intact. There was no RAPD, INO, loss of visual acuity. Glucose 178 (elevated), ESR ,Lipid profile, GS, CBC with differential, Carotid duplex scan, EKG, and EEG were all normal. MRI brain, 9/30/96, was unchanged from previous, 3/6/95.On 1/3/97, he had a 30 second spell of lightheadedness without vertigo, but with balance difficulty, after picking up a box of books. The episode was felt due to orthostatic changes.1/8/97 neuropsychological evaluation was stable and his MMSE score was 25/30 (with deficits in visual construction, orientation, and 2/3 recall at 1 minute). Category fluency score 23 items/60 sec. Neurologic exam was notable for graphesthesia in the left hand.In 2/97, he had episodes of anxiety, marked fluctuations in job performance and resigned his pastoral position. His neurologic exam was unchanged. An FDG-PET scan on 2/14/97 revealed decreased uptake in the right posterior temporal-parietal and lateral occipital regions."
Neurology,"Month DD, YYYYXYZRE: ABCMEDICAL RECORD#: 123Dear Dr. XYZ:I saw ABC back in Neuro-Oncology Clinic today. He comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma.Within the last several days, he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion. The patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent. It is clear that his MRI is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective. Despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time.After seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen. They came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks. They then wanted another MRI to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation.From my view, I noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since I last saw him. This is very worrisome. Today, for the first time, I felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well. Therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor. It suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future.Emphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroids I once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation. Despite an hour, this again amazingly was not possible. It is not that he does not want treatment, however. Because I told him that I did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to Temodar in a low dose daily type regimen. We would plan on giving 75 mg/sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days. In addition, we will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day. If he tolerates this for one week, we then agree that we would institute another one of the medications that he listed for us. At this stage, we are thinking of using Accutane at that point.While I am very uncomfortable with this type of approach, I think as long as he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval. In the spirit of compromise, he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time, seemed more resigned to the fact that it was going to happen sooner than later. I will look at this as a positive sign because I think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term.I will keep you apprised of followups. If you have any questions or if I could be of any further assistance, feel free to contact me.Sincerely,"
Neurology,"CC: Seizures.HX: The patient was initially evaluated at UIHC at 7 years of age. He had been well until 7 months prior to evaluation when he started having spells which were described as """"dizzy spells"""" lasting from several seconds to one minute in duration. They occurred quite infrequently and he was able to resume activity immediately following the episodes. The spell became more frequent and prolonged, and by the time of initial evaluation were occurring 2-3 times per day and lasting 2-3 minutes in duration. In addition, in the 3 months prior to evaluation, the right upper extremity would become tonic and flexed during the episodes, and he began to experience post ictal fatigue.BIRTH HX: 32 weeks gestation to a G4 mother and weighed 4#11oz. He was placed in an incubator for 3 weeks. He was jaundiced, but there was no report that he required treatment.PMH: Single febrile convulsion lasting """"3 hours"""" at age 2 years.MEDS: none.EXAM: Appears healthy and in no acute distress. Unremarkable general and neurologic exam.Impression: Psychomotor seizures.Studies: Skull X-Rays were unremarkable.EEG showed """"minimal spike activity during hyperventilation, as well as random sharp delta activity over the left temporal area, in drowsiness and sleep. This record also showed moderate amplitude asymmetry ( left greater than right) over the frontal central and temporal areas, which is a peculiar finding.""""COURSE: The patient was initially treated with Phenobarbital; then Dilantin was added (early 1970's); then Depakene was added ( early 1980's) due to poor seizure control. An EEG on 8/22/66 showed """"Left mid-temporal spike focus with surrounding slow abnormality, especially posterior to the anterior temporal areas (sparing the parasagittal region). In addition, the right lateral anterior hemisphere voltage is relatively depressed. ...this suggests two separate areas of cerebral pathology."""" He underwent his first HCT scan in Sioux City in 1981, and this revealed an right temporal arachnoid cyst. The patient had behavioral problems throughout elementary/junior high/high school. He underwent several neurosurgical evaluations at UIHC and Mayo Clinic and was told that surgery was unwarranted. He was placed on numerous antiepileptic medication combinations including Tegretol, Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Depakote, Acetazolamide, and Mysoline. Despite this he averaged 2-3 spells a month. He was last seen, 6/19/95, and was taking Dilantin and Tegretol. His typical spells were described as sudden in onset and without aura. He frequently becomes tonic or undergoes tonic-clonic movement and falls with associated loss of consciousness. He usually has rapid recovery and can return to work in 20 minutes. He works at a Turkey packing plant. Serial HCT scans showed growth in the arachnoid cyst until 1991, when growth arrest appeared to have occurred."
Neurology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 58-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right arm pain. He states that a little less than a year ago he developed pain in his right arm. It is intermittent, but has persisted since that time. He describes that he experiences a dull pain in his upper outer arm. It occurs on a daily basis. He also experiences an achy sensation in his right hand radiating to the fingers. There is no numbness or paresthesias in the hand or arm.He has had a 30-year history of neck pain. He sought medical attention for this problem in 2006, when he developed ear pain. This eventually led to him undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine, which showed some degenerative changes. He was then referred to Dr. X for treatment of neck pain. He has been receiving epidural injections under the care of Dr. X since 2007. When I asked him what symptom he is receiving the injections for, he states that it is for neck pain and now the more recent onset of arm pain. He also has taken several Medrol dose packs, which has caused his blood sugars to increase. He is taking multiple other pain medications. The pain does not interfere significantly with his quality of life, although he has a constant nagging pain.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has had diabetes since 2003. He also has asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: He takes ACTOplus, albuterol, AndroGel, Astelin, Diovan, Dolgic Plus, aspirin 81 mg, fish oil, Lipitor, Lorazepam, multivitamins, Nasacort, Pulmicort, ranitidine, Singulair, Viagra, Zetia, Zyrtec, and Uroxatral. He also uses Lidoderm patches and multiple eye drops and creams.ALLERGIES: He states that Dyazide, Zithromax, and amoxicillin cause him to feel warm and itchy.FAMILY HISTORY: His father died from breast cancer. He also had diabetes. He has a strong family history of diabetes. His mother is 89. He has a sister with diabetes. He is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders.SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives alone. He works full time in Human Resources for the State of Maryland. He previously was an alcoholic, but quit in 1984. He also quit smoking cigarettes in 1984, after 16 years of smoking. He has a history of illicit drug use, but denies IV drug use. He denies any HIV risk factors and states that his last HIV test was over two years ago.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He has intermittent chest discomfort. He has chronic tinnitus. He has urinary dribbling. Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above. This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Vital Signs: HR 72. RR 16.General Appearance: Patient is well appearing, in no acute distress.Cardiovascular: There is a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. There are no carotid bruits.Chest: The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.Skin: There are no rashes or lesions.NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:Mental Status: Speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia. The patient is alert and oriented to name, place, and date. Attention, concentration, registration, recall, and fund of knowledge are all intact.Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Optic discs are normal. Visual fields are full. Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus. Facial sensation is normal. There is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness. Hearing is grossly intact. Shoulder shrug is full.Motor: There is normal muscle bulk and tone. There is no atrophy or fasciculations. There is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia. Manual muscle testing reveals MRC grade 5/5 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities.Sensory: Sensation is intact to light touch, pinprick, temperature, vibratory sensation, and joint position sense. Romberg is absent.Coordination: There is no dysmetria or ataxia on finger-nose-finger or heel-to-shin testing.Deep Tendon Reflexes: Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ at the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellas and ankles. Plantar reflexes are flexor. There are no finger flexors, Hoffman's sign, or jaw jerk.Gait and Stance: Casual gait is normal. Heel, toe, and tandem walking are all normal.RADIOLOGIC DATA: MRI of the cervical spine, 05/19/08: I personally reviewed this film, which showed narrowing of the foramen on the right at C4-C5 and other degenerative changes without central stenosis.IMPRESSION: The patient is a 58-year-old gentleman with one-year history of right arm pain. He also has a longstanding history of neck pain. His neurological examination is normal. He has an MRI that shows some degenerative changes. I do believe that his symptoms are probably referable to his neck. However, I do not think that they are severe enough for him to undergo surgery at this point in time. Perhaps another course of physical therapy may be helpful for him. I probably would not recommend anymore invasive procedure, such as a spinal stimulator, as this pain really is minimal. We could still try to treat him with neuropathic pain medications.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. I scheduled him to return for an EMG and nerve conduction studies to determine whether there is any evidence of nerve damage, although I think the likelihood is low.2. I gave him a prescription for Neurontin. I discussed the side effects of the medication with him.3. We can discuss his case tomorrow at Spine Conference to see if there are any further recommendations."

His gag response had returned and he was eating without difficulty. Sensation had returned to his extremities."
Neurology,"CC: Episodic confusion.HX: This 65 y/o RHM reportedly suffered a stroke on 1/17/92. He presented locally at that time with complaint of episodic confusion and memory loss lasting several minutes per episode. The """"stroke"""" was reportedly verified on MRI scan dated 1/17/92. He was subsequently placed on ASA and DPH. He admitted that there had been short periods (1-2 days duration) since then, during which he had forgotten to take his DPH. However, even when he had been taking his DPH regularly, he continued to experience the spells mentioned above. He denied any associated tonic/clonic movement, incontinence, tongue-biting, HA, visual change, SOB, palpitation, weakness or numbness. The episodes of confusion and memory loss last 1-2 minutes in duration, and have been occurring 2-3 times per week.PMH: Bilateral Hearing Loss of unknown etiology, S/P bilateral ear surgery many years ago.MEDS: DPH and ASASHX/FHX: 2-4 Beers/day. 1-2 packs of cigarettes per day.EXAM: BP 111/68, P 68BPM, 36.8C.

Pathologic analysis was consistent with a Grade 2 astrocytoma. GFAP staining positive. Following surgery he underwent 5040 cGy radiation therapy in 28 fractions to the tumor bed."
Neurology,"CC: Headache.HX: 63 y/o RHF first seen by Neurology on 9/14/71 for complaint of episodic vertigo. During that evaluation she described a several year history of """"migraine"""" headaches. She experienced her first episode of vertigo in 1969. The vertigo (clockwise) typically began suddenly after lying down, and was not associated with nausea/vomiting/headache. The vertigo had not been consistently associated with positional change and could last hours to days.On 3/15/71, after 5 day bout of vertigo, right ear ache, and difficulty ambulating (secondary to the vertigo) she sought medical attention and underwent an audiogram which reportedly showed a 20% decline in low tone acuity AD. She complained of associated tinnitus which she described as a """"whistle."""" In addition, her symptoms appeared to worsen with changes in head position (i.e. looking up or down). The symptoms gradually resolved and she did well until 8/71 when she experienced a 19-day episode of vertigo, tinnitus and intermittent headaches. She was seen 9/14/71, in Neurology, and admitted for evaluation.Her neurologic exam at that time was unremarkable except for prominent bilateral systolic carotid bruits. Cerebral angiogram revealed an inoperable 7 x 6cm AVM in the right parietal region. The AVM was primarily fed by the right MCA. Otolaryngologic evaluation concluded that she probably also suffered from Meniere's disease.On 10/14/74 she underwent a 21 day admission for SAH secondary to right parietal AVM.On 11/23/91 she was admitted for left sided weakness (LUE > LLE), headache, and transient visual change. Neurological exam confirmed left sided weakness, and dysesthesia of the LUE only. Brain CT confirmed a 3 x 4 cm left parietal hemorrhage. She underwent unsuccessful embolization. Neuroradiology had planned to do 3 separate embolizations, but during the first, via the left MCA, they were unable to cannulate many of the AVM vessels and abandoned the procedure. She recovered with residual left hemisensory loss.In 12/92 she presented with an interventricular hemorrhage and was managed conservatively and refused any future neuroradiologic intervention.In 1/93 she reconsidered neurointerventional procedure and was scheduled for evaluation at the Barrows Neurological Institute in Phoenix, AZ."
Neurology,"SUBJECTIVE: The patient is a 75-year-old female who comes in today with concerns of having a stroke. She states she feels like she has something in her throat. She started with some dizziness this morning and some left hand and left jaw numbness. She said that she apparently had something about three weeks ago where she was dizzy and ended up falling down and she saw Dr. XYZ for that who gave her some Antivert. She said that today though she woke up in the middle of the night and her left hand was numb and she was having numbness on the left side of her face, as well as the left side of her neck. She said she had an earache a day or so ago. She has not had any cold symptoms.ALLERGIES: Demerol and codeine.MEDICATIONS: Lotensin, Lopid, metoprolol, and Darvocet.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient says that she feels little bit nauseated at times. She denies chest pain or shortness of breath and again feels like she has something in her throat. She has been able to swallow liquids okay. She said that she did brush her teeth this morning and did not have any fluid dripping out of her mouth. She does say that she occasionally has numbness in her left hand prior to today.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:General: She is awake and alert, no acute distress.Vital Signs: Blood pressure: 175/86. Temperature: She is afebrile. Pulse: 78. Respiratory rate: 20. O2 sat: 93% on room air.HEENT: Her TMs are normal bilaterally. Posterior pharynx is unremarkable. It should be noted that her uvula did not deviate and neither did her tongue. When she smiles though she has some drooping of the left side of her face, as well as some mild nasolabial fold flattening.Neck: Without adenopathy or thyromegaly. Carotids pulses are brisk without bruits.Lungs: Clear to auscultation.Heart: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.Extremities: Her muscle strength is symmetrical and intact bilaterally. DTRs are 2+/4+ bilaterally and muscle strength is intact in the upper extremities. She has a positive Tinels sign on her left wrist.Neurological: I also took monofilament and she could sense it easily when testing her sensation on her face.ASSESSMENT: Bells Palsy.PLAN: We did get an EKG showed some ST segment changes anterolaterally. The only EKG I have here is from 1998 and she actually had bypass in 1999, but there certainly does not appear to be anything acute on his EKG. I assured her that it does not look like she has a stroke. If she wants to prevent a stroke, obviously quitting her smoking would help. It should be noted she also takes Synthroid and Zocor. We are going to give her Valtrex 1 g t.i.d. for seven days and then if she starts noticing any other drooping or worsening of her symptoms on the left side of her face, she needs to come back, but I will not start her on steroids at this time, which she agreed with."
Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Carotid artery occlusive disease.2. Peripheral vascular disease.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Carotid artery occlusive disease.2. Peripheral vascular disease.OPERATIONS PERFORMED:1. Bilateral carotid cerebral angiogram.2. Right femoral-popliteal angiogram.FINDINGS: The right carotid cerebral system was selectively catheterized and visualized. The right internal carotid artery was found to be very tortuous with kinking in its cervical portions, but no focal stenosis was noted. Likewise, the intracranial portion of the right internal carotid artery showed no significant disease nor did the right middle cerebral artery.The left carotid cerebral system was selectively catheterized and visualized. The cervical portion of the left internal carotid artery showed a 30 to 40% stenosis with small ulcer crater present. The intracranial portion of the left internal carotid artery showed no significant disease nor did the left middle cerebral artery.Visualization of the right lower extremity showed no significant disease.PROCEDURE: With the patient in supine position under local anesthesia plus intravenous sedation, the groin areas were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.The common femoral artery was punctured in a routine retrograde fashion and a 5-French introducer sheath was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance. A catheter was then placed in the aortic arch and the right and left common carotid arteries were then selectively catheterized and visualized as described above.Following completion of the above, the catheter and introducer sheath were removed. Heparin had been initially given, which was reversed with protamine. Firm pressure was held over the puncture site for 20 minutes, followed by application of a sterile Coverlet dressing and sandbag compression.The patient tolerated the procedure well throughout."
Neurology,"CC: Orthostatic lightheadedness.HX: This 76 y/o male complained of several months of generalized weakness and malaise, and a two week history of progressively worsening orthostatic dizziness. The dizziness worsened when moving into upright positions. In addition, he complained of intermittent throbbing holocranial headaches, which did not worsen with positional change, for the past several weeks. He had lost 40 pounds over the past year and denied any recent fever, SOB, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, hemoptysis, melena, hematochezia, bright red blood per rectum, polyuria, night sweats, visual changes, or syncopal episodes.He had a 100+ pack-year history of tobacco use and continued to smoke 1 to 2 packs per day. He has a history of sinusitis.EXAM: BP 98/80 mmHg and pulse 64 BPM (supine); BP 70/palpable mmHG and pulse 84BPM (standing). RR 12, Afebrile. Appeared fatigued.CN: unremarkable.Motor and Sensory exam: unremarkable.Coord: Slowed but otherwise unremarkable movements.Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout all 4 extremities. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally.The rest of the neurologic and general physical exam was unremarkable.LAB: Na 121 meq/L, K 4.2 meq/L, Cl 90 meq/L, CO2 20meq/L, BUN 12mg/DL, CR 1.0mg/DL, Glucose 99mg/DL, ESR 30mm/hr, CBC WNL with nl WBC differential, Urinalysis: SG 1.016 and otherwise WNL, TSH 2.8 IU/ML, FT4 0.9ng/DL, Urine Osmolality 246 MOSM/Kg (low), Urine Na 35 meq/L,COURSE: The patient was initially hydrated with IV normal saline and his orthostatic hypotension resolved, but returned within 24-48hrs. Further laboratory studies revealed: Aldosterone (serum)<2ng/DL (low), 30 minute Cortrosyn Stimulation test: pre 6.9ug/DL (borderline low), post 18.5ug/DL (normal stimulation rise), Prolactin 15.5ng/ML (no baseline given), FSH and LH were within normal limits for males. Testosterone 33ng/DL (wnl). Sinus XR series (done for history of headache) showed an abnormal sellar region with enlarged sella tursica and destruction of the posterior clinoids. There was also an abnormal calcification seen in the middle of the sellar region. A left maxillary sinus opacity with air-fluid level was seen. Goldman visual field testing was unremarkable. Brain CT and MRI revealed suprasellar mass most consistent with pituitary adenoma. He was treated with Fludrocortisone 0.05 mg BID and within 24hrs, despite discontinuation of IV fluids, remained hemodynamically stable and free of symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. His presumed pituitary adenoma continues to be managed with Fludrocortisone as of this writing (1/1997), though he has developed dementia felt secondary to cerebrovascular disease (stroke/TIA)."
Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tremor, dystonic form.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tremor, dystonic form.COMPLICATIONS: None.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 100 mL.ANESTHESIA: MAC (monitored anesthesia care) with local anesthesia.TITLE OF PROCEDURES:1. Left frontal craniotomy for placement of deep brain stimulator electrode.2. Right frontal craniotomy for placement of deep brain stimulator electrode.3. Microelectrode recording of deep brain structures.4. Stereotactic volumetric CT scan of head for target coordinate determination.5. Intraoperative programming and assessment of device.INDICATIONS: The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of dystonic tremor. The movements have been refractory to aggressive medical measures, felt to be candidate for deep brain stimulation. The procedure is discussed below.I have discussed with the patient in great deal the risks, benefits, and alternatives. She fully accepted and consented to the procedure.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the holding area and to the operating room in stable condition. She was placed on the operating table in seated position. Her head was shaved. Scalp was prepped with Betadine and a Leksell frame was mounted after anesthetizing the pin sites with a 50:50 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 2% lidocaine in all planes. IV antibiotics were administered as was the sedation. She was then transported to the CT scan and stereotactic volumetric CT scan of the head was undertaken. The images were then transported to the surgery planned work station where a 3-D reconstruction was performed and the target coordinates were then chosen. Target coordinates chosen were 20 mm to the left of the AC-PC midpoint, 3 mm anterior to the AC-PC midpoint, and 4 mm below the AC-PC midpoint. Each coordinate was then transported to the operating room as Leksell coordinates.The patient was then placed on the operating table in a seated position once again. Foley catheter was placed, and she was secured to the table using the Mayfield unit. At this point then the patient's right frontal and left parietal bossings were cleaned, shaved, and sterilized using Betadine soap and paint in scrubbing fashion for 10 minutes. Sterile drapes placed around the perimeter of the field. This same scalp region was then anesthetized with same local anesthetic mixture.A bifrontal incision was made as well as curvilinear incision was made over the parietal bossings. Bur holes were created on either side of the midline just behind the coronal suture. Hemostasis was controlled using bipolar and Bovie, and self-retaining retractors had been placed in the field. Using the drill, then two small grooves were cut in the frontal bone with a 5-mm cutting burs and Stryker drill. The bur holes were then curetted free, the dura cauterized, and then opened in a cruciate manner on both sides with a #11 blade. The cortical surface was then nicked with a #11 blade on both sides as well. The Leksell arc with right-sided coordinate was dialed in, was then secured to the frame. Microelectrode drive was secured to the arc. Microelectrode recording was then performed. The signatures of the cells were recognized. Microelectrode unit was removed. Deep brain stimulating electrode holding unit was mounted. The DBS electrode was then loaded into target and intraoperative programming and testing was performed. Using the screener box and standard parameters, the patient experienced some relief of symptoms on her left side. This electrode was secured in position using bur-hole ring and cap system.Attention was then turned to the left side, where left-sided coordinates were dialed into the system. The microelectrode unit was then remounted. Microelectrode recording was then undertaken. After multiple passes, the microelectrode unit was removed. Deep brain stimulator electrode holding unit was mounted at the desired trajectory. The DBS electrode was loaded into target, and intraoperative programming and testing was performed once again using the screener box. Using standard parameters, the patient experienced similar results on her right side. This electrode was secured using bur-hole ring and cap system. The arc was then removed. A subgaleal tunnel was created between the two incisions whereby distal aspect of the electrodes led through this tunnel.We then closed the electrode, replaced subgaleally. Copious amounts of Betadine irrigation were used. Hemostasis was controlled using the bipolar only. Closure was instituted using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion for the fascial layer followed by skin closure with staples. Sterile dressings were applied. The Leksell arc was then removed.She was rotated into the supine position and transported to the recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition. All needle, sponge, cottonoid, and blade counts were correct x2 as verified by the nurses."
Neurology,"EXAM: Bilateral carotid ultrasound.REASON FOR EXAM: Headache.TECHNIQUE: Color grayscale and Doppler analysis is employed.FINDINGS: On the grayscale images, the right common carotid artery demonstrates patency with mild intimal thickening only. At the level of the carotid bifurcation, there is heterogeneous hard plaque present, but without grayscale evidence of greater than 50% stenosis. Right common carotid waveform is normal with a peak systolic velocity of 0.474 m/second and an end-diastolic velocity of 0.131 m/second. The right ECA is patent as well with the velocity measurement 0.910 m/second.The right internal carotid artery at the bifurcation demonstrates plaque formation, but no evidence of greater than 50% stenosis. Proximal peak systolic velocity in the internal carotid artery is 0.463 m/second with proximal end-diastolic velocity of 0.170. The mid internal carotid peak systolic velocity is 0.564 m/second, and mid ICA end-diastolic velocity is 0.199 m/second. Right ICA distal PSV 0.580 m/second, right ICA distal EDV 0.204 m/second. Vertebral flow is antegrade on the right at 0.469 m/second.On the left, the common carotid artery demonstrates intimal thickening, but is otherwise patent. At the level of the bifurcation, however, there is more pronounced plaque formation with approximately 50% stenosis by the grayscale analysis. See the velocity measurements below:Left carotid ECA measurement 0.938 m/second. Left common carotid PSV 0.686 m/second, and left common carotid end-diastolic velocity 0.137 m/second.Left internal carotid artery again demonstrates prominent focus of hard plaque with up to at least 50% stenosis. This should be further assessed with CTA for more precise measurement. The left proximal ICA/PSV 0.955 m/second, left proximal ICA/EDV 0.287 m/second. There is spectral broadening in the proximal aspect of the carotid waveform. The left carotid ICA mid PSV 0.895, left carotid ICA mid EDV 0.278 with also spectral broadening present.The left distal ICA/PSV 0.561, left distal ICA/EDV 0.206, again the spectral broadening present. Vertebral flow is antegrade at 0.468 m/second.IMPRESSION: The study demonstrates bilateral hard plaque at the bifurcation, left greater than right. There is at least 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery at its bifurcation and a followup CTA is recommended for further assessment."
Neurology,"CC: Headache (HA)HX: 10 y/o RHM awoke with a bilateral parieto-occipital HA associated with single episode of nausea and vomiting, 2 weeks prior to presentation. The nausea and vomiting resolved and did not recur. However, he continued to experience similar HA 3-4 times per week during the early morning upon awakening. He never felt the HA awakened him from sleep. The HA were partially relieved by Tylenol or Advil, and he distracted himself from the pain by remaining active. One week prior to presentation, he started to experience short episodes of blurred vision and diplopia. He also became fatigued, less active, and frequently yawned.He had no prior history of HA and he and his family denied any sign or symptom of focal weakness or numbness, dysphagia, dysarthria, or loss of consciousness.The patient underwent an MRI brain scan prior to transfer to UIHC. This revealed a mass in the left frontal region adjacent to the left temporal horn. The mass was an inhomogeneous blend of signals on T1 and T2 images giving a suggestion of acute bleeding, hemosiderin deposition and multiple vessels within the mass.MEDS: None.PMH: 1) He was a 7# 15oz. product of a full term, uncomplicated pregnancy and spontaneous vaginal delivery. His post-partum course was unremarkable. 2)Developmental milestones were reached at the appropriate times; though he was diagnosed with dyslexia 4 years ago. 3) No significant illnesses or hospitalizations.FHX: MGF (meningioma). PGF (lymphoma). Mother (migraine HA). Father and 22yr old brother are alive and well.SHX: lives with parents and attends mainstream 5th grade classes.EXAM: BP124/93 HR96 RR20 37.9C (tympanic)MS: A & O to person, place, time. Cooperative and interactive. Speech fluent and without dysarthria.CN: EOM intact. VFFTC, Pupils 3/3 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Fundoscopy: optic disks flat, no evidence of hemorrhage. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable.MOTOR: full strength throughout all 4 extremities. Normal muscle tone and bulk.Sensory: unremarkable.Coord: unremarkable.Station: no pronator drift or Romberg signGait: unremarkable.Reflexes: 2+ in RUE and RLE. 3 in LUE and LLE. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally.HEENT: no meningismus. no cranial bruits. no skull defects palpated.GEN EXAM: unremarkable.COURSE: GS, PT/PTT, CBC were unremarkable. The MRI finding above lead to a differential diagnosis of Venous Angioma, Arteriovenous Malformation, Ependymoma, Neurocytoma, Glioma: all with associated hemorrhage.He underwent cerebral angiography on 1/25/93. Upon injection of the RCCA an avascular mass was identified in the right temporal lobe displacing the anterior choroidal artery, and temporal branches of the middle cerebral arteries. The internal cerebral vein is displaced to the left suggesting mass effect. There is a hypoplastic A1 segment and fetal origin of the LPCA. The mass was felt by neuroradiology to represent a hematoma.He underwent a right frontal craniotomy, 1/28/93. Pathological evaluation of the resected tissue was consistent with a vascular malformation with inclusive reactive glial tissue and evidence of recurrent and remote hemorrhage. There were dilated vascular channels having walls of variable thickness, but without evidence of elastic lamina by elastic staining. This was consistent with venous angioma/malformation."
Neurology,"CC: Falling to left.HX: 26y/oRHF fell and struck her head on the ice 3.5 weeks prior to presentation. There was no associated loss of consciousness. She noted a dull headache and severe sharp pain behind her left ear 8 days ago. The pain lasted 1-2 minutes in duration. The next morning she experienced difficulty walking and consistently fell to the left. In addition the left side of her face had become numb and she began choking on food. Family noted her pupils had become unequal in size. She was seen locally and felt to be depressed and admitted to a psychiatric facility.

HCT on admission was negative. MRI Brain (done locally 2/2/93) was reviewed and a left lateral medullary stroke was appreciated. The patient underwent a cerebral angiogram on 2/3/93 which revealed significant narrowing of the left vertebral artery beginning at C2 and extending to and involving the basilar artery. There is severe, irregular narrowing of the horizontal portion above the posterior arch of C1. The findings were felt consistent with a left vertebral artery dissection. Neuro-opthalmology confirmed a left Horner's pupil by clinical exam and history. Cookie swallow study was unremarkable. The Patient was placed on Heparin then converted to Coumadin. The PT on discharge was 17.She remained on Coumadin for 3 months and then was switched to ASA for 1 year. An Otolaryngologic evaluation on 10/96 noted true left vocal cord paralysis with full glottic closure. A prosthesis was made and no surgical invention was done."

Neurology,"Doctor's NameDoctor's AddressDear Doctor:This letter serves as an introduction to my patient, A, who will be seeing you in the near future. He is a pleasant young man who has a diagnosis of bulbar cerebral palsy and hypotonia. He has been treated by Dr. X through the pediatric neurology clinic. He saw Dr. X recently and she noted that he was having difficulty with mouth breathing, which was contributing to some of his speech problems. She also noted and confirmed that he has significant tonsillar hypertrophy. The concern we have is whether he may benefit from surgery to remove his tonsils and improve his mouth breathing and his swallowing and speech. Therefore, I ask for your opinion on this matter.For his chronic allergic rhinitis symptoms, he is currently on Flonase two sprays to each nostril once a day. He also has been taking Zyrtec 10 mg a day with only partial relief of the symptoms. He does have an allergy to penicillin.I appreciate your input on his care. If you have any questions regarding, please feel free to call me through my office. Otherwise, I look forward to hearing back from you regarding his evaluation."
Neurology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 58-year-old male who reports a six to eight-week history of balance problems with fatigue and weakness. He has had several falls recently. He apparently had pneumonia 10 days prior to the onset of the symptoms. He took a course of amoxicillin for this. He complained of increased symptoms with more and more difficulty with coordination. He fell at some point near the onset of the symptoms, but believes that his symptoms had occurred first. He fell from three to five feet and landed on his back. He began seeing a chiropractor approximately five days ago and had adjustments of the neck and lumbar spine, although he clearly had symptoms prior to this.He has had mid and low back pain intermittently. He took a 10-day course of Cipro believing that he had a UTI. He denies, however, any bowel or bladder problems. There is no incontinence and he does not feel that he is having any difficulty voiding.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He has a history of surgery on the left kidney, when it was """"rebuilt."""" He has had knee surgery, appendectomy and right inguinal hernia repair.MEDICATIONS: His only home medications had been Cipro and Aleve. However, he does take aspirin and several over the counter supplements including a multivitamin with iron, """"natural"""" potassium, Starlix and the aspirin.ALLERGIES: HE HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.SOCIAL HISTORY: He smokes one-and-one-half-packs of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol at least several days per week. He is employed in sales, which requires quite a bit of walking, but he is not doing any lifting. He had been a golfer in the past.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has had documented cervical spondylosis, apparently with an evaluation over 15 years ago.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 156/101, pulse was 88, respirations 18. He is afebrile.MENTAL STATUS: He is alert.CRANIAL NERVES: His pupils were reactive to light. He had a dense left cataract present. The right disk margin appears sharp. His eye movements were full. The face was symmetric. Pain and temperature sensation were intact over both sides of the face. The tongue was midline.NECK: His neck was supple.MUSCULOSKELETAL: He has intact strength and normal tone in the upper extremities. He had increased tone in both lower extremities. He had hip flexion of 4/5 on the left. He had intact strength on the right lower extremity, although had slight hammertoe deformity bilaterally.NEUROLOGIC: His reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities, 3+ at the knees and 1+ at the ankles. He withdrew to plantar stimulation on the left, but did not have a Babinski response clearly present. He had intact finger-to-nose testing. Marked impairment in heel-to-shin testing. He was able to sit unassisted. He stood with assistance, but had a markedly ataxic gait. On sensory exam, he had a slight distal gradient to pin and vibratory sense in both lower extremities, but also had a decrease in sensation to pin over the right lower extremity compared to the left.CARDIOVASCULAR: He had no carotid bruits. His heart rhythm was regular.BACK: There was no focal back pain present. He did have a slight sensory level at the upper T spine at approximately T3, both anteriorly and posteriorly.RADIOLOGIC DATA: MRI by my view showed essentially unremarkable T spine. The MRI of his C spine showed significant spondylosis in the mid and lower C spine with spondylolisthesis at C7-T1. There is an abnormal signal in the cord which begins at approximately this level, but descends approximately 2 cm. There is slight enhancement at the mid-portion of the lesion. This appears to be an intrinsic lesion to the cord, not clearly associated with mild to moderate spinal stenosis at the level of the spondylolisthesis.LABORATORY: His initial labs were unremarkable.IMPRESSION: Cervical cord lesion at the C7 to T2 level of unclear etiology. Consider a transverse myelitis, tumor, contusion or ischemic lesion.PLAN: Will check labs including sedimentation rate, MRI of the brain, chest x-ray. He will probably need a lumbar puncture. He also appears to have a mild peripheral neuropathy, which I suspect is an independent problem. We will request labs for this."
Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: Followup cervical spinal stenosis.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her cervical spinal stenosis. I have last seen her on 06/19/07. Her symptoms of right greater than left upper extremity pain, weakness, paresthesias had been worsening after an incident on 06/04/07, when she thought she had exacerbated her conditions while lifting several objects.I referred her to obtain a cervical spine MRI.She returns today stating that she continues to have right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, weakness, which she believes radiates from her neck. She had some physical therapy, which has been helping with the neck pain. The right hand weakness continues. She states she has a difficult time opening jars, and doors, and often drops items from her right greater than left upper extremity. She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her.She has been undergoing nonoperative management by Dr. X and feels this has been helping her neck pain, but not the upper extremity symptoms.She denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction. No lower back pain, no lower extremity pain, and no instability with ambulation.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for fevers, chills, chest pain, and shortness of breath.FINDINGS: On examination, Ms. ABC is a very pleasant well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress. Alert and oriented x3. Normocephalic and atraumatic. Afebrile to touch.She ambulates with a normal gait.Motor strength is 4 plus out of 5 in the bilateral deltoids, biceps, triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 in the bilateral hand intrinsic muscle groups, grip strength 4 out of 5, 4 plus out of 5 bilateral wrist extension and wrist flexion.Light touch sensation decreased in the right greater than left C6 distribution. Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 3 plus. Hoffman sign normal bilaterally.Lower extremity strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups. Patellar reflex is 3 plus. No clonus.Cervical spine radiographs dated 06/21/07 are reviewed.They demonstrate evidence of spondylosis including degenerative disk disease and anterior and posterior osteophyte formation at C4-5, C5-6, C6-7, and C3-4 demonstrates only minimal if any degenerative disk disease. There is no significant instability seen on flexion-extension views.Updated cervical spine MRI dated 06/21/07 is reviewed.It demonstrates evidence of moderate stenosis at C4-5, C5-6. These stenosis is in the bilateral neural foramina and there is also significant disk herniation noted at the C6-7 level. Minimal degenerative disk disease is seen at the C6-7. This stenosis is greater than C5-6 and the next level is more significantly involved at C4-5.Effacement of the ventral and dorsal CSF space is seen at C4-5, C5-6.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. ABC's history, physical examination, and radiographic findings are compatible with C4-5, C5-6 cervical spinal stenosis with associated right greater than left upper extremity radiculopathy including weakness.I spent a significant amount of time today with the patient discussing the diagnosis, prognosis, natural history, nonoperative, and operative treatment options.I laid out the options as continued nonoperative management with physical therapy, the same with the addition of cervical epidural steroid injections and surgical interventions.The patient states she would like to avoid injections and is somewhat afraid of having these done. I explained to her that they may help to improve her symptoms, although they may not help with the weakness.She feels that she is failing maximum nonoperative management and would like to consider surgical intervention.I described the procedure consisting of C4-5, C5-6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion to the patient in detail on a spine model.I explained the rationale for doing so including the decompression of the spinal cord and improvement of her upper extremity weakness and pain. She understands.I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternative of the procedure including material risks of bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, dural tear, singular or multiple muscle weakness, paralysis, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and the risk of this given the patient's relatively young age. Of note, the patient does have a hoarse voice right now, given the fact that she feels she has allergies.I also discussed the option of disk arthroplasty. She understands.She would like to proceed with the surgery, relatively soon. She has her birthday coming up on 07/20/07 and would like to hold off, until after then. Our tentative date for the surgery is 08/01/07. She will go ahead and continue the preoperative testing process."
Neurology,"REASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION: Cervical spondylosis and kyphotic deformity. The patient was seen in conjunction with medical resident Dr. X. I personally obtained the history, performed examination, and generated the impression and plan.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain. This has subsequently resolved. She started vigorous workouts in November 2005. In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician. By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made. She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits. She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe. Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe. She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm. She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg. Symptoms have been mildly progressive. She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above. She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms. No particular position relieves her symptoms.Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed below. She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised. At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Ocular migraines.2. Myomectomy.3. Infertility.4. Hyperglycemia.5. Asthma.6. Hypercholesterolemia.MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Pulmicort, Allegra, Xopenex, Patanol, Duac topical gel, Loprox cream, and Rhinocort.ALLERGIES: Penicillin and aspirin.Family history, social history, and review of systems are discussed above as well as documented in the new patient information sheet. Of note, she does not drink or smoke. She is married with two adopted children. She is a paralegal specialist. She used to exercise vigorously, but of late has been advised to stop exercising and is currently only walking.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She does complain of mild blurred vision, but these have occurred before and seem associated with headaches.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, blood pressure 138/82, pulse 90, respiratory rate 14, and weight 176.5 pounds. Pain scale is 0. A full general and neurological examination was personally performed and is documented on the chart. Of note, she has a normal general examination. Neurological examination reveals normal cognition and cranial nerve examination including normal jaw jerk. She has mild postural tremor in both arms. She has mild decreased sensation in the right palm and mild decreased light touch in the right palm and decreased vibration sense in both distal lower extremities. Motor examination reveals no weakness to individual muscle testing, but on gait she does have a very subtle left hemiparesis. She has hyperreflexia in her lower extremities, worse on the left. Babinski's are downgoing.PERTINENT DATA: MRI of the brain from 05/02/06 and MRI of the C-spine from 05/02/06 and 07/25/06 were personally reviewed. MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits. MRI of the C-spine reveals large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema. There is also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space. I do not appreciate any cord edema at this level.IMPRESSION AND PLAN: The patient is a 45-year-old female with cervical spondylosis with a large C6-C7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level. She has a small disc at C3-C4 with less severe and only subtle cord compression. History and examination are consistent with signs of a myelopathy.Results were discussed with the patient and her mother. I am concerned about progressive symptoms. Although she only has subtle symptoms now, we made her aware that with progression of this process, she may have paralysis. If she is involved in any type of trauma to the neck such as motor vehicle accident, she could have an acute paralysis. I strongly recommended to her and her mother that she followup with you as soon as possible for surgical evaluation. I agree with the previous physicians who have told her not to exercise as I am sure that her vigorous workouts and weight training since November 2005 have contributed to this problem. I have recommended that she wear a hard collar while driving. The results of my consultation were discussed with you telephonically."
Neurology,"CC: Intermittent binocular horizontal, vertical, and torsional diplopia.HX: 70y/o RHM referred by Neuro-ophthalmology for evaluation of neuromuscular disease. In 7/91, he began experiencing intermittent binocular horizontal, vertical and torsional diplopia which was worse and frequent at the end of the day, and was eliminated when closing one either eye. An MRI Brain scan at that time was unremarkable. He was seen at UIHC Strabismus Clinic in 5/93 for these symptoms. On exam, he was found to have intermittent right hypertropia in primary gaze, and consistent diplopia in downward and rightward gaze. This was felt to possibly represent Grave's disease. Thyroid function studies were unremarkable, but orbital echography suggested Graves orbitopathy. The patient was then seen in the Neuro-ophthalmology clinic on 12/23/92. His exam remained unchanged. He underwent Tensilon testing which was unremarkable. On 1/13/93, he was seen again in Neuro-ophthalmology. His exam remained relatively unchanged and repeat Tensilon testing was unremarkable. He then underwent a partial superior rectus resection, OD, with only mild improvement of his diplopia. During his 8/27/96 Neuro-ophthalmology clinic visit he was noted to have hypertropia OD with left pseudogaze palsy and a right ptosis. The ptosis improved upon administration of Tensilon and he was placed on Mestinon 30mg tid. His diplopia subsequently improved, but did not resolve. The dosage was increased to 60mg tid and his diplopia worsened and the dose decreased back to 30mg tid. At present he denied any fatigue on repetitive movement. He denied dysphagia, SOB, dysarthria, facial weakness, fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss or muscle atrophy.MEDS: Viokase, Probenecid, Mestinon 30mg tid.PMH: 1) Gastric ulcer 30 years ago, 2) Cholecystectomy, 3) Pancreatic insufficiency, 4) Gout, 5) Diplopia.FHX: Mother died age 89 of """"old age."""" Father died age 89 of stroke. Brother, age 74 with CAD, Sister died age 30 of cancer.SHX: Retired insurance salesman and denies history of tobacco or illicit drug us. He has no h/o ETOH abuse and does not drink at present.EXAM: BP 155/104. HR 92. RR 12. Temp 34.6C. WT 76.2kg.MS: Unremarkable. Normal speech with no dysarthria.CN: Right hypertropia (worse on rightward gaze and less on leftward gaze). Minimal to no ptosis, OD. No ptosis, OS. VFFTC. No complaint of diplopia. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable.MOTOR: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone.SENSORY: No deficits appreciated on PP/VIB/LT/PROP/TEMP testing.Coordination/Station/Gait: Unremarkable.Reflexes: 2/2 throughout. Plantar responses were flexor on the right and withdrawal on the left.HEENT and GEN EXAM: Unremarkable.COURSE: EMG/NCV, 9/26/96: Repetitive stimulation studies of the median, facial, and spinal accessory nerves showed no evidence of decrement at baseline, and at intervals up to 3 minutes following exercise. The patient had been off Mestinon for 8 hours prior to testing. Chest CT with contrast, 9/26/96, revealed a 4x2.5x4cm centrally calcified soft tissue anterior mediastinal mass adjacent to the aortic arch. This was highly suggestive of a thymoma. There were diffuse emphysematous disease with scarring in the lung bases. A few nodules suggestive of granulomas and few calcified perihilar lymph nodes. He underwent thoracotomy and resection of the mass. Pathologic analysis was consistent with a thymoma, lymphocyte predominant type, with capsular and pleural invasion, and extension to the phrenic nerve resection margin. Acetylcholine Receptor-binding antibody titer 12.8nmol/L (normal<0.7), Acetylcholine receptor blocking antibody <10% (normal), Acetylcholine receptor modulating antibody 42% (normal<19), Striated muscle antibody 1:320 (normal<1:10). Striated muscle antibody titers tend to be elevated in myasthenia gravis associated with thymoma. He was subsequently treated with XRT and continued to complain of fatigue at his 4/18/97 Oncology visit."
Neurology,"Thank you very much for asking me to see this very interesting and pleasant woman for neurological evaluation with regards to a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. She is present in the company of her husband.As you know, the patient is a 50-year-old right-handed Caucasian female, who works as an independent contractor and as a human resources consultant.Her neurological history first begins in December of 1987, when she had a rather sudden onset of slurred speech and the hesitancy when she started to walk. She had HMO insurance at that time and saw a neurologist, whose name she does not recall. She thinks that she underwent MRI scan of the brain and possibly visual evoked response and brainstem auditory evoked response tests. She was told that all the tests were normal and no diagnosis was made.The slurred speech resolved after a few weeks, but her gait hesitancy persisted for a number of years and then finally partially improved. She also began to note that she would fatigue after very prolonged walking.In about 1993, she developed bladder urgency and frequency along with some nocturia. She saw a urologist and underwent urodynamic testing. She was diagnosed as having """"overactive bladder"""", but the cause of this was never determined. She was treated with medications, possibly Ditropan, without much benefit. She also developed a dry mouth from the medication and so she discontinued it.Also in about 1993, she began to note an uncomfortable """"stiffness"""" in her feet and slight swelling of the ankles. Apparently, the swelling was not visible by others. She saw multiple physicians and was told that it was """"not arthritis"""", but no definite diagnosis was ever established. She saw at least two rheumatologists on several occasions and blood tests were all normal. No clear-cut diagnosis was ever made and the patient simply learned to live with these symptoms.However, over time she noted that the symptoms in her legs seemed to worsen somewhat. She states from time-to-time she could """"barely walk"""". She felt as if her balance is impaired and she felt as if she were """"walking on stilts"""". She tried arch supports from a podiatrist without any benefit. She began to tire more easily when walking.In 2002 she was seen by a podiatrist, who noticed an abnormal gait and recommended that she see a neurologist.In the fall of 2002, she was seen by Dr. X. He ordered an MRI scan of her brain and lumbar spine. He also did some sort of nerve testing and possibly visual evoked response testing. After reviewing everything, he diagnosed multiple sclerosis. However, prior to starting her on immunomodulatory therapy, he referred her for a second opinion to Dr. Y, in January of 2003. Dr. Y confirmed the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.The patient then returned to Dr. X and was started on Avonex. She continued on it for about six months. However, it made her feel much more stiff and delayed and so she finally stopped it. She also recalled being tried on baclofen by Dr. X, but again it did not benefit her and made her feel slightly dizzy. So, she discontinued it also.At that point in time, she decided to try a program of """"good nutrition, vitamin supplements, and fish oil"""".In December 2004 and extending up to February 2005, she began to note progressively more severe swelling and stiffness in the distal lower extremities. She began to have to use a cane. She was seen in neurological consultation by Dr. Z. She was treated with a Medrol Dosepak. Her spasticity and swelling seemed to improve dramatically. However, within about two weeks symptoms were back to baseline.She was then treated with intravenous Solu-Medrol 500 mg daily for five days followed by a prednisone or Medrol taper (July 2005). This seemed to be less helpful than the oral steroids, but was partially beneficial. However, it wore off once again.A repeat MRI scan of the brain in April 2005 was said to """"look better"""". She was started on Zanaflex for her lower extremity spasticity without benefit.Finally six days ago, she was restarted on oral prednisone 10 mg tablets. She takes one-half tablet daily and this again has seemed to reduce the swelling and stiffness in her legs. She continues on the prednisone in the same dosage for relief of the spasticity.She has not been on any other immunomodulatory agents.The patient does note some complaints of mild heat sensitivity and mild easy fatigability. There is no history of diplopia, dysarthria, aphasia, focal weakness, numbness, paresthesias, cognitive dysfunction, or memory dysfunction.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Essentially noncontributory.ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to LOBSTER and VICODIN. She feels that she is probably allergic to IODINE.SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke. She takes one glass of wine per day.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She has not had any prior surgeries. Her general health has been excellent except for the above-indicated problems.REVIEW OF OUTSIDE RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES: The patient brought with her today MRI scans of the brain, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on 11/14/02 on a 1.5-Tesla magnet. There are numerous T2 hyperintense lesions in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the brain and at least one lesion is in the corpus callosum. There appear to be Dawson's fingers. The MRI of the thoracic and lumbosacral spines did not reveal any significant abnormalities.Also available are the MRI scans of the brain, cervical spine, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on a 0.35-Tesla magnet on 04/22/05. The MRI of the brain shows that one of the prior lesions has resolved and there appear to be one or two more lesions.However, the quality of the newer scan is only 0.35-Tesla and is suboptimal. Visualization of the cord is also suboptimal, but there are no clear-cut extraaxial or complexities of the spinal cord. It is difficult to be certain that there are no intra-axial lesions, but I could not clearly see one.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Vital signs: Blood pressure 151/88, pulse 92, temperature 99.5ºF, and weight 124 lb (dressed).General: Well-developed, well-nourished female in no acute distress.Head: Normocephalic, without evidence of trauma or bruits.Neck: Supple, with full range of motion. No spasm or tenderness. Carotid pulsations are of normal volume and contour bilaterally without bruits. No thyromegaly or adenopathy.Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, edema, or deformity. Range of motion full throughout.NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:Mental Status: Awake, alert, oriented to time, place, and person; appropriate. Recent and remote memory intact. No evidence of right-left confusion, finger agnosia, dysnomia or aphasia.CRANIAL NERVES:II: Visual fields full to confrontation. Fundi benign.III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements full throughout, without nystagmus. No ptosis. Pupils equal, round and react briskly to light and accommodation.V: Normal sensation to light touch and pinprick bilaterally. Corneal reflexes equal bilaterally. Motor function normal.VII: No facial asymmetry.VIII: Hears finger rub bilaterally. Weber and Rinne tests normal.IX & X: Palate elevates symmetrically bilaterally with phonation. Gag reflex equal bilaterally.XI: Sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius normal tone, bulk and strength bilaterally.XII: Tongue midline without atrophy or fasciculations. Rapid alternating movements normal. No dysarthria.Motor: Tone, bulk, and strength are normal in both upper extremities. In the lower extremities, there is moderate spasticity on the right and moderately severe spasticity on the left. There are bilateral Achilles' contractures more so on the left than the right and also a slight left knee flexion contracture.Strength in the lower extremities is rated as follows on a 5-point scale (right/left): Iliopsoas 4+/5-, quadriceps 5-/5-, tibialis anterior 4+/4+, and gastrocnemius 5/5. There are no tremors, fasciculations or abnormal involuntary movements.Reflexes (right/left): Biceps 3/3, triceps 3/3, brachioradialis 3/3, knee jerk 4/4, and ankle jerk 4/0. Plantar responses are extensor bilaterally. No pathological reflexes.Coordination: Finger-nose-finger testing and rapid alternating movements appear to be normal in both upper extremities. The lower extremities could not be adequately tested because of spasticity and weakness.Gait: The patient has a spastic and slightly broad based gait. She is able to walk without support. After walking for a period of time, she is finally able to get her left foot down flat, but tends to walk on the left toes.Station: Romberg testing with the eyes open is normal. With the eyes closed, there is slight unsteadiness and she actually fell on one occasion, but was able to catch herself.Sensation: Intact to pinprick, light touch, vibration and position sense throughout. Normal stereognosis, graphesthesia, and double simultaneous stimulationDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: Multiple sclerosis, ? secondary progressive versus relapsing/remitting.CASE DISCUSSION: Thank you once again for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting lady. Based on review of her history and her current MRI scans, she seems to suffer from multiple sclerosis. She indicated that there was a slow progression of her disease from December 2004 to February 2005 and perhaps beyond that. She also indicated that she has some improvement with oral steroids and to a lesser extent with IV steroids. However, she keeps slipping back. Overall however, she thinks that she is better now than she was several months ago suggesting that this may have been a slow exacerbation rather than actual progression of her MS.At this point in time, she appears to be confusing symptom treatment with treatment of her multiple sclerosis. Steroids can relieve spasticity in selected patients. However, they are not good long-term choices because of the obvious side effects that we see with long-term use of steroids. So, although she has benefit from the current prednisone dosage, I feel it would be more appropriate to try and find something else to help her with her spasticity. She is unable to tolerate Zanaflex and baclofen because of sedation.I have recommended a trial of Neurontin beginning at 100 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. and gradually increasing as needed up to 300 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Additional increases may be necessary depending on how she does with these lower doses. Some patients may take as high as 1000-1500 mg three to four times daily. If the Neurontin cannot be tolerated or it does not bring about any relief of her spasticity, I would consider Klonopin 0.25 mg-1 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. or Valium 5-10 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. If these are not helpful or if there are intolerable side effects, she should be considered for baclofen pump.I spent a lot of time discussing with her baclofen pump, as she was unfamiliar with it, although she has initially and understandably opposed to this treatment, she may well require this treatment in the future in order to allow her to ambulate adequately. With the baclofen pump in place, the patient should have good relief of spasticity and be able to exercise her legs strongly.It is not clear to me whether she is actually having secondary progressive MS or relapsing/remitting MS. I feel it would be appropriate to start her on immunomodulatory therapy. Since interferon made her spasticity worse, I would recommend a trial of Copaxone.I would also obtain an annual MRI scan of the brain; however, this should be accomplished with a high-field strength magnet (1.5-Tesla or greater).If she has worsening of her clinical condition or should her MRI show continued worsening, I would recommend consideration of adding methotrexate or CellCept to her regimen. She may also be a candidate for Tysabri if it returns to the market place in the next few months.She is currently not much troubled by her bladder symptoms and so I do not think she needs any particular treatment for this problem currently. However, should her symptoms worsen in the future, urological consultation by a physician familiar with neurogenic bladder would be helpful.Finally, I feel that she will benefit from some physical therapy. I have recommended physical therapy evaluation and treatment three times weekly for six weeks.The patient currently has HMO insurance and I recommended that she followup here on an as needed basis. She should followup with you for her regularly scheduled medical appointments.The patient indicates that she may be moving to Tulsa, Oklahoma in the near future and I gave her the names of two MS physicians in Dallas, which is apparently only about a two-hour ride away.Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about her case."
Neurology,"The patient states that she has been having some problems with her memory for maybe the past year or two. She states that they have been slowly progressive. She had a consultation with an outside neurologist and was told that she likely has Alzheimer disease and was prescribed Aricept and was told that she should not drive. Per the dictation that is available to us in clinic, it appears that she was before a DMV. It appears that the patient wanted a second opinion, so she now presents for consultation on possible Alzheimer disease.The patient states that she has been doing fairly well at home. She balances her own checkbook. She does not do her own taxes, but she has never done so in the past. She states that she has no problems with cooking meals, getting her own meals, and she is still currently driving. She denies burning any dishes because she forgot them on the stove or forgetting what she is doing in the middle of a task or getting lost while she is driving around or getting lost in her own home. She states that she is very good remembering the names of her family members and does not forget important birthdays such as the date of birth of her grandchildren. She is unfortunately living alone, and although she seems to miss her grandchildren and is estranged from her son, she denies any symptoms of frank depression. There is unfortunately no one available to us to corroborate how well she is doing at home. She lives alone and takes care of herself and does not communicate very much with her brother and sister. She also does not communicate very much with her son who lives in Santa Cruz or her grandchildren. She denied any sort of personality change, paranoid ideas or hallucinations. She does appear to have headaches that can be severe about four times a month and have primarily photophobia and some nausea and occasionally emesis associated with it. When these headaches are very severe, she goes to the emergency room to get a single shot. She is unclear if this is some sort of a migraine medication or just a primary pain medication. She takes Fiorinal for these headaches and she states that this helps greatly. She denies visual or migraine symptoms.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for any sort of focal neurologic deficits such as weakness, numbness, visual changes, dysarthria, diplopia or dysphagia. She also denies any sort of movement disorders, tremors, rigidities or clonus. Her personal opinion is that some of her memory problems may be due to simply to her age and/or nervousness. She is unclear as if her memory is any worse than anyone else in her age group.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for mesothelioma, which was diagnosed seemingly more than 20 to 25 years ago. The patient was not sure of exactly when it was diagnosed. This has been treated surgically by debulking operations for which she states that she has undergone about 10 operations. The mesothelioma is in her abdomen. She does not know of any history of having lung mesothelioma. She states that she has never gotten chemotherapy or radiation for her mesothelioma. Furthermore, she states that her last surgical debulking was more than 10 years ago and her disease has been fairly stable. She does have a history of three car accidents that she says were all rear-enders where she was hit while essentially in a stopped position. These have all occurred over the past five years. She also has a diagnosis of dementing illness, possibly Alzheimer disease from her previous neurology consultation. This diagnosis was given in March 2006.MEDICATIONS: Fiorinal, p.r.n. aspirin, unclear if baby or full sized, Premarin unclear of the dose.ALLERGIES: NONE.SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for her being without a companion at this point. She was born in Munich, Germany. She immigrated to of America in 1957 after her family had to move to Eastern Germany, which was under Russian occupation at that time. She is divorced. She used to work as a secretary and later worked as a clerical worker at IBM. She stopped working more than 20 years ago due to complications from her mesothelioma. She denies any significant tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs. She is bilingual speaking, German and English. She has known English from before her teens. She has the equivalent of a high school education in Germany. She has one brother and one sister, both of whom are healthy and she does not spend much time communicating with them. She has one son who lives in Santa Cruz. He has grandchildren. She is trying to contact with her grandchildren.FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for lung, liver, and prostate cancer. Her mother died in her 80s of """"old age,"""" but it appears that she may have had a mild dementing illness at that time. Whatever that dementing illness was, appears to have started mostly in her 80s per the patient. No one else appears to have Alzheimer disease including her brother and sister.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her blood pressure is 152/92, pulse 80, and weight 80.7 kg. She is alert and well nourished in no apparent distress. She occasionally fumbles with questions of orientation, missing the day and the date. She also did not know the name of the hospital, she thought it was O'Connor and she thought she was in Orange County and also did not know the floor of the hospital that we are in. She lost three points for recall. Even with prompting, she could not remember the objects that she was given to remember. Her Mini Mental Score was 22/30. There were no naming problems or problems with repetition. There were also no signs of dysarthria. Her pupils were bilaterally reactive to light and accommodation. Her extraocular movements were intact. Her visual fields were full to confrontation. Her sensations of her face, arm, and leg were normal. There were no signs of neglect with double simultaneous stimulation. Tongue was midline. Her palate was symmetric. Her face was symmetric as well. Strength was approximately 5/5. She did have some right knee pain and she had a mildly antalgic gait due to her right knee pain. Her reflexes were symmetric and +2 except for her toes, which were +1 to trace. Her plantar reflexes were mute. Her sensation was normal for pain, temperature, and vibration. There were no signs of ataxia on finger-to-nose and there was no dysdiadochokinesia. Gait was narrow and she could toe walk briefly and heel walk without difficulty.SUMMARY: Ms. A is a pleasant 72-year-old right-handed woman with a history of mesothelioma that appears stable at this time and likely mild dementia, most likely Alzheimer type. We tactfully discussed the patient's diagnosis with her, and she felt reassured. We told her that this most likely was in the earlier stages of disease and she would benefit from trying Aricept. She stated that she did not have the prescription anymore from her outpatient neurology consult for the Aricept, so we wrote her another prescription for Aricept. The patient herself seemed very concerned about the stigma of the disease, but our lengthy discussion, expressed genuine understanding as to why her outpatient physician had reported her to DMV. It was explicitly told to not drive by her outpatient neurologist and we concur with this assessment. She will follow up with us in the next six months and will call us if she has any problems with the Aricept. She was written for Aricept to start at 5 mg for three weeks, and if she has no side effects which typically are GI side effects, then she can go up to 10 mg a day. We also reviewed with Ms. A the findings for outpatient MRI, which showed some mild atrophy per report and also that her metabolic workup, which included an RPR, TSH, and B12 were all within normal limits."
Neurology,"I had the pleasure of reevaluating Ms. A in our neurology clinic today for history of right upper pons and right cerebral peduncle infarction in April of 2008. Since her last visit in May of 2009, Ms. A stated that there has been no concern. She continues to complain of having mild weakness on the left leg at times and occasional off and on numbness in the left hand. She denied any weakness in the arm. She stated that she is ambulating with a cane. She denied any history of falls. Recently, she has also had repeat carotid Dopplers or further imaging studies of which we have no results of stating that she has further increased stenosis in her left internal carotid artery and there is a plan for surgery at Hospital with Dr. X. Of note, we have no notes to confirm that. Her daughter stated that she has planned for the surgery. Ms. A on today's office visit had no other complaints.FAMILY HISTORY AND SOCIAL HISTORY: Reviewed and remained unchanged.MEDICATIONS: List remained unchanged including Plavix, aspirin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, Lasix, insulin and simvastatin.ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies.FALL RISK ASSESSMENT: Completed and there was no history of falls.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Full review of systems again was pertinent for shortness of breath, lack of energy, diabetes, hypothyroidism, weakness, numbness and joint pain. Rest of them was negative.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Vital Signs: Today, blood pressure was 170/66, heart rate was 66, respiratory rate was 16, she weighed 254 pounds as stated, and temperature was 98.0.General: She was a pleasant person in no acute distress.HEENT: Normocephalic and atraumatic. No dry mouth. No palpable cervical lymph nodes. Her conjunctivae and sclerae were clear.NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: Remained unchanged.Mental Status: Normal.Cranial Nerves: Mild decrease in the left nasolabial fold.Motor: There was mild increased tone in the left upper extremity. Deltoids showed 5-/5. The rest showed full strength. Hip flexion again was 5-/5 on the left. The rest showed full strength.Reflexes: Reflexes were hypoactive and symmetrical.Gait: She was mildly abnormal. No ataxia noted. Wide-based, ambulated with a cane.IMPRESSION: Status post cerebrovascular accident involving the right upper pons extending into the right cerebral peduncle with a mild left hemiparesis, has been clinically stable with mild improvement. She is planned for surgical intervention for the internal carotid artery.RECOMMENDATIONS: At this time, again we discussed continued use of antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy to reduce her risk of future strokes. She will continue to follow with endocrinology for diabetes and thyroid problems. I have recommended a strict control of her blood sugar, optimizing cholesterol and blood pressure control, regular exercise and healthy diet and I have discussed with Ms. A and her daughter to give us a call for post surgical recovery. I will see her back in about four months or sooner if needed."
Neurology,"REASON FOR REFERRAL: Facial twitching.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient had several episodes where she felt like her face was going to twitch, which she could suppress it with grimacing movements of her mouth and face. She reports she is still having right posterior head pressure like sensations approximately one time per week. These still are characterized by a tingling, pressure like sensation that often has a feeling as though water is running down on her hair. This has also decreased in frequency occurring approximately one time per week and seems to respond to over-the-counter analgesics such as Aleve. Lastly during conversation today, she brought again the problem of daydreaming at work and noted that she occasionally falls asleep when sitting in non-stimulating environments or in front of the television. She states that she feels fatigued all the time and does not get good sleep. She describes it as insomnia, but upon questioning she works from 4 till mid night and then gets home and cannot go to sleep for approximately two hours and wakes up reliably by 9.00 a.m. each morning and sleeps no more than five to six hours ever, but usually five hours. Her sleep is relatively uninterrupted except for the need to get up and go to the bathroom. She thinks she may snore, but she is not sure. She does not recall any events of awakening and gasping for breath.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Please see my earlier notes in chart.FAMILY HISTORY: Please see my earlier notes in chart.SOCIAL HISTORY: Please see my earlier notes in charts.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Today, she mainly endorses the tingling sensation in the right posterior head often bilateral as well as a diagnosis of depression and persistent somewhat sad mood, poor sleep, and possible snoring; otherwise, the 10-system review is negative.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:General Examination: Unremarkable mainly for mild-to-moderate obesity with a weight of 258 pounds. Otherwise, general examination is unremarkable.NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: As before is nonfocal. Please see note in chart for details.PERTINENT FINDINGS: Since the last evaluation, she has had an MRI performed, which was largely unremarkable except for a 1.2 cm lobular T2 hyperintense abnormality at the right clivus and petrous carotid canal, which does not enhance. The nature of this lesion is unclear. Certainly, this abnormality would not explain her left facial twitching and is unlikely to be involved with the right posterior sensory changes she experiences.LABS: She was supposed to have Lyme titers and thyroid tests as well as fasting glucose, which were not done; however, in light of her improvement these may not need to be performed at this time.IMPRESSION:1. Left facial twitching-appears to be improving. Most likely, this is a peripheral nerve injury related to her abscess as previously described. In light of her negative MRI and clinical improvement, we discussed options and elected to just observe for now.2. Posterior pressure like headache, also appears to be improving. The etiology is unclear, but as it responds nicely to nonsteroidal antiinflammatories and is decreasing, no further evaluation is needed.3. Probable circadian sleep disorder related to her nighttime work schedule and awakening at 9.00 a.m. with insufficient sleep. There is also the possibility of consistent obstructive sleep apnea and if symptoms worsen then we should consider doing a sleep study. For the time being, sleep hygiene measures were discussed with the patient including trying to sleep later at least till 10.00 a.m. or 10.30 to get a full-night sleep. She is on vacation next week and is going to try to see if this will help. We also discussed as before weight loss and exercise, which could be helpful.4. Right clivus and petrous lesion of unknown etiology. We will repeat the MRI at four months to see for interval change.5. The patient voiced understanding of these plans and will be following up with me in five months."
Neurology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 36-year-old female with past medical history of migraine headaches, who was brought to the ER after she was having uncontrolled headaches. In the ER, the patient had a CT scan done, which was reported negative, and lumbar puncture with normal pressure and the cell count, and was admitted for followup. Neurology consult was called to evaluate the patient in view of the current symptomatology. The headaches were refractory to the treatment. The patient has been on Topamax and Maxalt in the past, but did not work and according to the patient she got more confused.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: History of migraine.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for partial oophorectomy, appendectomy, and abdominoplasty.SOCIAL HISTORY: No history of any smoking, alcohol, or drug abuse. The patient is a registered nurse by profession.MEDICATIONS: Currently taking no medication.ALLERGIES: No known allergies.FAMILY HISTORY: Nothing significant.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient was considered to ask systemic review including neurology, psychiatry, sleep, ENT, ophthalmology, pulmonary, cardiology, gastroenterology, genitourinary, hematology, rheumatology, dermatology, allergy, immunology, endocrinology, toxicology, oncology, and was found to be positive for the symptoms mentioned in the history of the presenting illness.PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONVITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure of 115/66, heart rate of 69, respiratory rate of 13, temperature normal, and pulse oximetry 98% on room air at the time of initial evaluation.HEENT: Head, normocephalic, atraumatic. Neck supple. Throat clear. No discharge from the ears or nose. No discoloration of conjunctivae and sclerae. No bruits auscultated over temple, orbits, or the neck.LUNGS: Clear to auscultation.CARDIOVASCULAR: Normal heart sounds.ABDOMEN: Benign.EXTREMITIES: No edema, clubbing or cyanosis.SKIN: No rash. No neurocutaneous disorder.MENTAL STATUS: The patient is awake, alert and oriented to place and person. Speech is fluent. No language deficits. Mood normal. Affect is clear. Memory and insight is normal. No abnormality with thought processing and thought content. Cranial nerve examination intact II through XII. Motor examination: Normal bulk, tone and power. Deep tendon reflexes symmetrical. Downgoing toes. No sign of any myelopathy. Cortical sensation intact. Peripheral sensation grossly intact. Vibratory sense not tested. Gait not tested. Coordination is normal with no dysmetria.IMPRESSION: Intractable headaches, by description to be migraines. Complicated migraines by clinical criteria. Rule out sinusitis. Rule out vasculitis including temporal and arthritis, lupus, polyarthritis, moyamoya disease, Takayasu and Kawasaki disease.PLAN AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The patient to be given a trial of the prednisone with a plan to taper off in 6 days, as she already had received 50 mg today. Depakote as a part of migraine prophylaxis and Fioricet on p.r.n. basis.The patient to get vasculitis workup, as it has not been ordered by the primary care physician initially. The patient already had MRI of the brain and the cervical spine. MRI of the brain reported negative and cervical spine as shown signs of disk protrusion at C5 and C6 level, which will not explain of the temporal headache. Plan and followup discussed with the patient in detail."
Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: The patient is an 84-year-old man who returns for revaluation of possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus. He is accompanied by his wife and daughter.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: I first saw him nearly a year ago on December 20, 2007. At that time, he had had a traumatic deterioration over the course of approximately eight months. This included severe cognitive impairment, gait impairment, and incontinence. He had actually been evaluated at Hospital with CSF drainage via a temporary spinal catheter, but there was no response that was noted. When I saw him, there were findings consistent with cervical stenosis and I ordered an MRI scan of the cervical spine. I subsequently referred him to Dr. X, who performed a cervical laminectomy and instrumented fusion on July 16, 2008. According to his notes this went well.According to the family, there has not been any improvement.With regard to the gait and balance, they actually think that he is worse now than he was a year ago. He is virtually unable to walk at all. He needs both a walker and support from an assistant to be able to stand or walk. Therefore, he is always in the wheelchair.He is completely incontinent. He never indicates his need to the go to the bathroom. On the other hand when asked, he will indicate that he needs to go. He wears a Depends undergarment all the time.He has no headaches.His thinking and memory are worse. For the most part, he is apathetic. He does not talk very much. He lives in a skilled nursing facility in the Alzheimer's section. He does have some daytime activities. He takes a nap once a day. He does not read very much. On the other hand, he did recently exercise the right to vote in the presidential election. He needs full assistance at the nursing home.MEDICATIONS: From the list by the nursing home are Aricept 10 mg in the evening, carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 mg three times a day, citalopram (Celexa) 40 mg daily, Colace 100 mg twice a day, finasteride (Proscar) 5 mg once a day, Flomax (tamsulosin) 0.4 mg once a day, multivitamin with iron once a day, omeprazole (Prilosec) 20 mg once a day, senna 8.6 mg twice a day, Tylenol 650 mg as needed, and promethazine 25 mg as needed.PHYSICAL EXAM: On examination today, this is a pleasant 81-year-old man who is brought back from the clinic waiting area in a wheelchair. He is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.Vital Signs: Temperature 96.7, pulse 62, respirations 16, and blood pressure 123/71.Head: The head is normocephalic and atraumatic.Mental Status: Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge. The Mini-Mental State Exam score was 14/30. He was not at all oriented. He did know we were at Sinai Hospital on the second floor. He could spell 'world' forward, but was mute when asked to spell backwards. He was mute when asked to recall 3/3 objects for delayed recall. He could not copy a diagram of intersecting pentagons. For comparison, the Mini-Mental State exam score last December was 20/30 when attention was tested by having him spell 'world' backwards and 28/30 when tested with serial 7 subtractions. Additionally, there are times when he stutters or stammers. I do not see any paraphasic errors. There is some evidence of ideomotor apraxia. He is also stimulus bound. There is a tendency to mimic.Cranial Nerve Exam: There is no upgaze that I can elicit today. The horizontal gaze and down gaze are intact. This is a change from a year ago. The muscles of facial expiration are intact as are hearing, head turning, cough, tongue, and palate movement.Motor Exam: Normal bulk and strength. The tone is characterized by paratonia. There is no atrophy, fasciculations, drift, or tremor.Sensory Exam: Intact to light touch.Cerebellar Exam: Intact for finger-to-nose testing that he can perform only by mimicking, but not by following verbal commands.Gait: Severely impaired. When in the wheelchair, he leans to one side. He cannot getup on his own. He needs assistance. Once up, he can bear weight, but cannot maintain his balance. This would amount to a Tinetti score of zero.REVIEW OF X-RAYS: I personally reviewed the CT scan of the brain from November 1, 2008 and compared it to the MRI scan from a year ago. The ventricles appear larger to me now in comparison to a year ago. The frontal horn span is now 6 cm, whereas previously it was about 5.5 cm. The 3rd ventricular span is about 15 mm. There is no obvious atrophy, although there may be some subtle bilateral perisylvian atrophy. The scan from a year ago showed that there was a patent sylvian aqueduct.ASSESSMENT: The patient has had worsening of his gait, his dementia, and his incontinence. The new finding for me today is the limited upgaze. This would be consistent either with progressive supranuclear palsy, which was one of the differential diagnoses a year ago, or it could be consistent with progressive enlargement of the ventricles.PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:1. Question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).2. Possible supranuclear palsy.3. Severe gait impairment.4. Urinary urgency and incontinence.5. Dementia.PLAN: I had a long talk with him and his family. Even though he has already had a trial of CSF drainage via spinal catheter at Hospital over a year ago, I offered this test to them again. I do so on the basis that there is further enlargement of the ventricles on the scan. His family and I discussed the facts that it is not likely to be only hydrocephalus. Instead we are trying to answer the question of whether hydrocephalus is contributing sufficiently to his symptoms that progressing with shunt surgery would make a difference. I have advised them to think it over for a day and contact my office to see whether they would wish to proceed. I gave them a printed prescription of the protocol including its rationale, risks, benefits, and alternatives. I specifically mentioned the 3% chance of infection, which mean a 97% chance of no infection."
Neurology,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Followup of seizures.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 47-year-old African-American female, well known to the neurology service, who has been referred to me for the first time evaluation of her left temporal lobe epilepsy that was diagnosed in August of 2002. At that time, she had one generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Apparently she had been having several events characterized by confusion and feeling unsteady lasting for approximately 60 seconds. She said these events were very paroxysmal in the sense they suddenly came on and would abruptly stop. She had two EEGs at that time, one on August 04, 2002 and second on November 01, 2002, both of which showed rare left anterior temporal sharp waves during drowsiness and sleep. She also had an MRI done on September 05, 2002, with and without contrast that was negative. Her diagnosis was confirmed by Dr. X at Johns Hopkins Hospital who reviewed her studies as well as examined the patient and felt that actually her history and findings were consistent with diagnosis of left temporal lobe epilepsy. She was initially started on Trileptal, but had some problems with the medication subsequently Keppra, which she said made her feel bad and subsequently changed in 2003 to lamotrigine, which she has been taking since then. She reports no seizures in the past several years. She currently is without complaint.In terms of seizure risk factors she denies head trauma, history of CNS infection, history of CVA, childhood seizures, febrile seizures. There is no family history of seizures.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant only for hypertension and left temporal lobe epilepsy.FAMILY HISTORY: Remarkable only for hypertension in her father. Her mother died in a motor vehicle accident.SOCIAL HISTORY: She works running a day care at home. She has three children. She is married. She does not smoke, use alcohol or illicit drugs.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Please see note in chart. Only endorses weight gain and the history of seizures, as well as some minor headaches treated with over-the-counter medications.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lamotrigine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d., verapamil, and hydrochlorothiazide.ALLERGIES: Flagyl and aspirin.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure is 138/88, heart rate is 76, respiratory rate is 18, and weight is 224 pounds, pain scale is none.General Examination: Please see note in chart, which is essentially unremarkable except mild obesity.NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: Again, please see note in chart. Mental status is normal, cranial nerves are intact, motor is normal bulk and tone throughout with no weakness appreciated in upper and lower extremities bilaterally. There is no drift and there are no abnormalities to orbit. Sensory examination, light touch, and temperature intact at all distal extremities. Cerebellar examination, she has normal finger-to-nose, rapid alternating movements, heel-to-shin, and foot tap.She rises easily from the chair. She has normal step, stride, arm swing, toe, heel, and tandem. Deep tendon reflexes are 2 and equal at biceps, brachioradialis, patella, and 1 at the ankles.She was seen in the emergency room for chest pain one month ago. CT of the head was performed, which I reviewed, dated September 07, 2006. The findings were within the range of normal variation. There is no evidence of bleeding, mass, lesions, or any evidence of atrophy.IMPRESSION: This is a pleasant 47-year-old African-American female with what appears to be cryptogenic left temporal lobe epilepsy that is very well controlled on her current dose of lamotrigine.PLAN:1. Continue lamotrigine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.2. I discussed with the patient the option of a trial of medications. We need to repeat her EEG as well as her MRI prior to weaning her medications. The patient wants to continue her lamotrigine at this time. I concur.3. The patient will be following up with me in six months."
Neurology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Worsening seizures.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A pleasant 43-year-old female with past medical history of CP since birth, seizure disorder, complex partial seizure with secondary generalization and on top of generalized epilepsy, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. The patient stated she was in her normal state of well being when she was experiencing having frequent seizures. She lives in assisted living. She has been falling more frequently. The patient was driving a scooter and apparently was hitting into the wall with unresponsiveness in association with this. There was no head trauma, but apparently she was doing that many times and there was no responsiveness. The patient has no memory of the event. She is now back to her baseline. She states her seizures are worse in the setting of stress, but it is not clear to her why this has occurred. She is on Carbatrol 300 mg b.i.d. and she has been very compliant and without any problems. The patient is admitted for EMU monitoring for the characterization of these episodes and for the possibility of complex partial epilepsy syndrome or better characterization of this current syndrome.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Include dyslipidemia and hypertension.FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for stroke and sleep apnea.SOCIAL HISTORY: No smoking or drinking.

Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: Postoperative visit for craniopharyngioma.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly, a 16-year-old right-handed boy who is in eleventh grade, who presents with some blurred vision and visual acuity difficulties, was found to have a suprasellar tumor. He was brought to the operating room on 01/04/07, underwent a transsphenoidal resection of tumor. Histology returned as craniopharyngioma. There is some residual disease; however, the visual apparatus was decompressed. According to him, he is doing well, back at school without any difficulties. He has some occasional headaches and tinnitus, but his vision is much improved.MEDICATIONS: Synthroid 100 mcg per day.FINDINGS: On exam, he is awake, alert and oriented x 3. Pupils are equal and reactive. EOMs are full. His visual acuity is 20/25 in the right (improved from 20/200) and the left is 20/200 improved from 20/400. He has a bitemporal hemianopsia, which is significantly improved and wider. His motor is 5 out of 5. There are no focal motor or sensory deficits. The abdominal incision is well healed. There is no evidence of erythema or collection. The lumbar drain was also well healed.The postoperative MRI demonstrates small residual disease.Histology returned as craniopharyngioma.ASSESSMENT: Postoperative visit for craniopharyngioma with residual disease.PLANS: I have recommended that he call. I discussed the options with our radiation oncologist, Dr. X. They will schedule the appointment to see him. In addition, he probably will need an MRI prior to any treatment, to follow the residual disease."
Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Multiple metastatic lesions to the brain, a subtentorial lesion on the left, greater than 3 cm, and an infratentorial lesion on the right, greater than 3 cm.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Multiple metastatic lesions to the brain, a subtentorial lesion on the left, greater than 3 cm, and an infratentorial lesion on the right, greater than 3 cm.TITLE OF THE OPERATION:1. Biparietal craniotomy and excision of left parietooccipital metastasis from breast cancer.2. Insertion of left lateral ventriculostomy under Stealth stereotactic guidance.3. Right suboccipital craniectomy and excision of tumor.4. Microtechniques for all the above.5. Stealth stereotactic guidance for all of the above and intraoperative ultrasound.INDICATIONS: The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a diagnosis of breast cancer made five years ago. A year ago, she was diagnosed with cranial metastases and underwent whole brain radiation. She recently has deteriorated such that she came to my office, unable to ambulate in a wheelchair. Metastatic workup does reveal multiple bone metastases, but no spinal cord compression. She had a consult with Radiation-Oncology that decided they could radiate her metastases less than 3 cm with stereotactic radiosurgery, but the lesions greater than 3 cm needed to be removed. Consequently, this operation is performed.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient underwent a planning MRI scan with Stealth protocol. She was brought to the operating room with fiducial still on her scalp. General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained. She was placed on the Mayfield head holder and rolled into the prone position. She was well padded, secured, and so forth. The neck was flexed so as to expose the right suboccipital region as well as the left and right parietooccipital regions. The posterior aspect of the calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine soak scrub followed by Betadine paint. This was done only, of course, after fiducial were registered in planning and an excellent accuracy was obtained with the Stealth system. Sterile drapes were applied and the accuracy of the system was confirmed. A biparietal incision was performed. A linear incision was chosen so as to increase her chances of successful wound healing and that she is status post whole brain radiation. A biparietal craniotomy was carried out, carrying about 1 cm over toward the right side and about 4 cm over to the left side as guided by the Stealth stereotactic system. The dura was opened and reflected back to the midline. An inner hemispheric approach was used to reach the very large metastatic tumor. This was very delicate removing the tumor and the co-surgeons switched off to spare one another during the more delicate parts of the operation to remove the tumor. The tumor was wrapped around and included the choroidal vessels. At least one choroidal vessel was sacrificed in order to obtain a gross total excision of the tumor on the parietal occipital region. Bleeding was quite vigorous in some of the arteries and finally, however, was completely controlled. Complete removal of the tumor was confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound.Once the tumor had been removed and meticulous hemostasis was obtained, this wound was left opened and attention was turned to the right suboccipital area. A linear incision was made just lateral to the greater occipital nerve. Sharp dissection was carried down in the subcutaneous tissues and Bovie electrocautery was used to reach the skull. A burr hole was placed down low using a craniotome. A craniotomy was turned and then enlarged as a craniectomy to at least 4 cm in diameter. It was carried caudally to the floor of the posterior fossa and rostrally to the transverse sinus. Stealth and ultrasound were used to localize the very large tumor that was within the horizontal hemisphere of the cerebellum. The ventriculostomy had been placed on the left side with the craniotomy and removal of the tumor, and this was draining CSF relieving pressure in the posterior fossa. Upon opening the craniotomy in the parietal occipital region, the brain was noted to be extremely tight, thus necessitating placement of the ventriculostomy.At the posterior fossa, a corticectomy was accomplished and the tumor was countered directly. The tumor, as the one above, was removed, both piecemeal and with intraoperative Cavitron Ultrasonic Aspirator. A gross total excision of this tumor was obtained as well.I then explored underneath the cerebellum in hopes of finding another metastasis in the CP angle; however, this was just over the lower cranial nerves, and rather than risk paralysis of pharyngeal muscles and voice as well as possibly hearing loss, this lesion was left alone and to be radiated and that it is less than 3 cm in diameter.Meticulous hemostasis was obtained for this wound as well.The posterior fossa wound was then closed in layers. The dura was closed with interrupted and running mattress of 4-0 Nurolon. The dura was watertight, and it was covered with blue glue. Gelfoam was placed over the dural closure. Then, the muscle and fascia were closed in individual layers using #0 Ethibond. Subcutaneous was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 and 0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 Nylon.For the cranial incision, the ventriculostomy was brought out through a separate stab wound. The bone flap was brought on to the field. The dura was closed with running and interrupted 4-0 Nurolon. At the beginning of the case, dural tack-ups had been made and these were still in place. The sinuses, both the transverse sinus and sagittal sinus, were covered with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam to take care of any small bleeding areas in the sinuses.Once the dura was closed, the bone flap was returned to the wound and held in place with the Lorenz microplates. The wound was then closed in layers. The galea was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 2-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running locking 3-0 Nylon.Estimated blood loss for the case was more than 1 L. The patient received 2 units of packed red cells during the case as well as more than 1 L of Hespan and almost 3 L of crystalloid.Nevertheless, her vitals remained stable throughout the case, and we hopefully helped her survival and her long-term neurologic status for this really nice lady."
Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right chronic subdural hematoma.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right chronic subdural hematoma.TYPE OF OPERATION: Right burr hole craniotomy for evacuation of subdural hematoma and placement of subdural drain.ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 100 cc.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: In preoperative identification, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position. Following induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepared for surgery. Table was turned. The right shoulder roll was placed. The head was turned to the left and rested on a doughnut. The scalp was shaved, and then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Incisions were marked along a putative right frontotemporal craniotomy frontally and over the parietal boss. The parietal boss incision was opened. It was about an inch and a half in length. It was carried down to the skull. Self-retaining retractor was placed. A bur hole was now fashioned with the perforator. This was widened with a 2-mm Kerrison punch. The dura was now coagulated with bipolar electrocautery. It was opened in a cruciate-type fashion. The dural edges were coagulated back to the bony edges. There was egress of a large amount of liquid. Under pressure, we irrigated for quite sometime until irrigation was returning mostly clear. A subdural drain was now inserted under direct vision into the subdural space and brought out through a separate stab incision. It was secured with a 3-0 nylon suture. The area was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with staples. Sterile dressing was applied. The patient was subsequently returned back to anesthesia. He was extubated in the operating room, and transported to PACU in satisfactory condition."
Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right frontotemporal chronic subacute subdural hematoma.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right frontotemporal chronic subacute subdural hematoma.TITLE OF THE OPERATION: Right frontotemporal craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma, biopsy of membranes, microtechniques.ASSISTANT: None.INDICATIONS: The patient is a 75-year-old man with a 6-week history of decline following a head injury. He was rendered unconscious by the head injury. He underwent an extensive syncopal workup in Mississippi. This workup was negative. The patient does indeed have a heart pacemaker. The patient was admitted to ABCD three days ago and yesterday underwent a CT scan, which showed a large appearance of subdural hematoma. There is a history of some bladder tumors and so a scan with contrast was obtained that showed some enhancement in the membranes. I decided to perform a craniotomy rather than burr hole drainage because of the enhancing membranes and the history of a bladder tumor undefined as well as layering of the blood within the cavity. The patient and the family understood the nature, indications, and risk of the surgery and agreed to go ahead.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room where general and endotracheal anesthesia was obtained. The head was turned over to the left side and was supported on a cushion. There was a roll beneath the right shoulder. The right calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine-soaked scrub followed by Betadine paint. Markings were applied. Sterile drapes were applied. A linear incision was made more or less along the coronal suture extending from just above the ear up to near the midline. Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue and Bovie electrocautery was used to divide the galea and the temporalis muscle and fascia. Weitlaner retractors were inserted. A single bur hole was placed underneath the temporalis muscle. I placed the craniotomy a bit low in order to have better cosmesis. A cookie cutter type craniotomy was then carried out in dimensions about 5 cm x 4 cm. The bone was set aside. The dura was clearly discolored and very tense. The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion with a #15 blade. There was immediate flow of a thin motor oil fluid under high pressure. Literally the fluid shot out several inches with the first nick in the membranous cavity. The dura was reflected back and biopsy of the membranes was taken and sent for permanent section. The margins of the membrane were coagulated. The microscope was brought in and it was apparent there were septations within the cavity and these septations were for the most part divided with bipolar electrocautery. The wound was irrigated thoroughly and was inspected carefully for any sites of bleeding and there were none. The dura was then closed in a watertight fashion using running locking 4-0 Nurolon. Tack-up sutures had been placed at the beginning of the case and the bone flap was returned to the wound and fixed to the skull using the Lorenz plating system. The wound was irrigated thoroughly once more and was closed in layers. Muscle fascia and galea were closed in separate layers with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl. Finally, the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 nylon.Estimated blood loss for the case was less than 30 mL. Sponge and needle counts were correct.FINDINGS: Chronic subdural hematoma with multiple septations and thickened subdural membrane.I might add that the arachnoid was not violated at all during this procedure. Also, it was noted that there was no subarachnoid blood but only subdural blood."
Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute left subdural hematoma.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute left subdural hematoma.PROCEDURE: Left frontal temporal craniotomy for evacuation of acute subdural hematoma.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: This is a 76-year-old man who has a history of acute leukemia. He is currently in the phase of his therapy where he has developed a profound thrombocytopenia and white cell deficiency. He presents after a fall in the hospital in which he apparently struck his head and now has a progressive neurologic deterioration consistent with an intracerebral injury. His CT imaging reveals an acute left subdural hematoma, which is hemispheric.The patient was brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia. He had previously been intubated and taken to the Intensive Care Unit and now is brought for emergency craniotomy. The images were brought up on the electronic imaging and confirmed that this was a left-sided condition. He was fixed in a three-point headrest. His scalp was shaved and prepared with Betadine, iodine and alcohol. We made a small curved incision over the temporal, parietal, frontal region. The scalp was reflected. A single bur hole was made at the frontoparietal junction and then a 4x6cm bur hole was created. After completing the bur hole flap, the dura was opened and a gelatinous mass of subdural was peeled away from the brain. The brain actually looked relatively relaxed; and after removal of the hematoma, the brain sort of slowly came back up. We investigated the subdural space forward and backward as we could and yet careful not to disrupt any venous bleeding as we close to the midline. After we felt that we had an adequate decompression, the dura was reapproximated and we filled the subdural space with saline. We placed a small drain in the extra dural space and then replaced the bone flap and secured this with the bone plates. The scalp was reapproximated, and the patient was awakened and taken to the CT scanner for a postoperative scan to ensure that there was no new hemorrhage or any other intracerebral pathology that warranted treatment. Given that this actual skin looked good with apparent removal of about 80% of the subdural we elected to take patient to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.I was present for the entire procedure and supervised this. I confirmed prior to closing the skin that we had correct sponge and needle counts and the only foreign body was the drain."
Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Brain tumors, multiple.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Brain tumors multiple - adenocarcinoma and metastasis from breast.PROCEDURE: Occipital craniotomy, removal of large tumor using the inner hemispheric approach, stealth system operating microscope and CUSA.PROCEDURE: The patient was placed in the prone position after general endotracheal anesthesia was administered. The scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. The CUSA was brought in to supplement the use of operating microscope as well as the stealth, which was used to localize the tumor. Following this, we then made a transverse linear incision, the scalp galea was reflected and the quadrilateral bone flap was removed after placing burr holes in the midline and over the parietal areas directly over the tumor. The bone flap was elevated. The ultrasound was then used. The ultrasound showed the tumors directly I believe are in the interhemispheric fissure. We noticed that the dura was quite tense despite that the patient had slight hyperventilation. We gave 4 ounce of mannitol, the brain became more pulsatile. We then used the stealth to perform a ventriculostomy. Once this was done, the brain began to pulsate nicely. We then entered the interhemispheric space after we incised the dura in an inverted U fashion based on the superior side of the sinus. After having done this we then used operating microscope and slight self-retaining retraction was used. We obtained access to the tumor. We biopsied this and submitted it. This was returned as a malignant brain tumor - metastatic tumor, adenocarcinoma compatible with breast cancer.Following this we then debulked this tumor using CUSA and then removed it in total. After gross total removal of this tumor, the irrigation was used to wash the tumor bed and a meticulous hemostasis was then obtained using bipolar cautery. The next step was after removal of this tumor, closure of the wound, a large piece of Duragen was placed over the dural defect and the bone flap was reapproximated and held secured with Lorenz plates. The tumors self extend into the ventricle and after we had removed the tumor, we could see our ventricular catheter in the occipital horn of the ventricle. This being the case, we left this ventricular catheter in, brought it out through a separate incision and connected to sterile drainage. The next step was to close the wound after reapproximating the bone flap. The galea was closed with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with interrupted 3-0 nylon sutures inverted with mattress sutures. The sterile dressings were applied to the scalp. The patient returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition. Hemodynamically remained stable throughout the operation.Once again, we performed occipital craniotomy, total removal of her large metastatic tumor involving the parietal lobe using a biparietal craniotomy. The tumor was removed using the combination of CUSA, ultrasound, stealth guided-ventriculostomy and the patient will have a second operation today, we will perform a selective craniectomy to remove another large tumor in the posterior fossa."
Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left acoustic neuroma.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left acoustic neuroma.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Left retrosigmoid craniotomy and excision of acoustic neuroma.ANESTHESIA: General.OPERATIVE FINDINGS: This patient had a 3-cm acoustic neuroma. The tumor was incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve. The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem at 0.05 milliamperes at the conclusion of the dissections.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Following induction of adequate general anesthetic, the patient was positioned for surgery. She was placed in a lateral position and her head was maintained with Mayfield pins. The left periauricular area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the sterile fashion. Transdermal electrodes for continuous facial nerve EMG monitoring were placed, and no response was verified. The proposed incision was injected with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine. Next, T-shaped incision was made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease. The incision was undermined at the level of temporalis fascia, and the portion of the fascia was harvested for further use.Incision was made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip. Periosteal elevator was used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone. Emissary veins posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax. Bergen retractors were used to maintain exposure. Using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy was performed. The sigmoid sinus was identified anteriorly and the transverse sites were identified superiorly. From these structures approximately 4 x 4 cm, a window of bone was removed. Bone shavings were collected during the dissection and placed in Siloxane suspension for later use. The bone flap was also left at the site for further use. Dissection was extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base. Bone wax was used to occlude air cells lateral to the sigmoid sinus. There was extensively aerated temporal bone. At this point, Dr. Trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor. The cerebellum was retracted away from the tumor, and the retractor was placed to help maintain exposure. Once initial exposure was completed, attention was directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone. The dura was excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone. Then, using diamond burs, the internal auditory canal was dissected out. The bone was removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm. There was considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal as well. The dura was then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor. The tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor was difficult. Therefore, Dr. Trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portions of the tumor. With dissection, he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem. The eighth nerve was identified and transected. Tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem. The facial nerve was difficult to identify at the brainstem as well. It was identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time was the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this was difficult to achieve. Attention was then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor was removed. The superior and inferior vestibular nerves were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus. At this point, plane of dissection was again indistinct. The tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated. The tumor was further debulked and thinned, but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor. The nerve could be stimulated, but was quite splayed over the anterior face. Further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempts were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve, both proximally and distally. However, the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve was not usually delineated. However, the tumor was then thinned using CUSA down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness. It was released from the brainstem ventrally. The tumor was then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery. The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 0.05 milliamperes. Overall, the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume. At this point, Dr. Trask re-inspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis. The air cells around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax. A piece of fascia was then laid over the bone defect. Next, the dura was closed with DuraGen and DuraSeal. The bone flap and bone ***** were then placed in the bone defect. Postauricular musculature was then reapproximated using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was also closed using interrupted subdermal 3-0 Vicryl sutures. Running 4-0 nylon suture was placed at the skin levels. Sterile mastoid dressing was then placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the PACU in a stable condition. All counts were correct at the conclusion of the procedure.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 100 mL."
Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Brain tumor left temporal lobe.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Brain tumor left temporal lobe - glioblastoma multiforme.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:1. Left temporal craniotomy.2. Removal of brain tumor.OPERATING MICROSCOPE: Stealth.PROCEDURE: The patient was placed in the supine position, shoulder roll, and the head was turned to the right side. The entire left scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion after having being placed in 2-point skeletal fixation. Next, we made an inverted-U fashion base over the asterion over temporoparietal area of the skull. A free flap was elevated after the scalp that was reflected using the burr hole and craniotome. The bone flap was placed aside and soaked in the bacitracin solution.The dura was then opened in an inverted-U fashion. Using the Stealth, we could see that this large cystic mass was just below the cortex in the white matter just anterior to the trigone of the ventricle. We head through the vein of Labbe, and we made great care to preserve this. We saw where the tumor almost made to the surface. Here we made a small corticectomy using the Stealth for guidance. We left small corticectomy entered large cavity with approximately 15 cc of yellowish necrotic liquid. This was submitted to pathology. We biopsied this very abnormal tissue and submitted it to pathology. They gave us a frozen section diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme. With the operating microscope and Greenwood bipolar forceps, we then systematically debulked this tumor. It was very vascular and we really continued to remove this tumor until all visible tumors was removed. We appeared to get two gliotic planes circumferentially. We could see it through the ventricle. After removing all visible tumor grossly, we then irrigated this cavity multiple times and obtained meticulous hemostasis and then closed the dura primarily with 4-0 Nurolon sutures with the piece of DuraGen placed over this in order to increase our chances for a good watertight seal. The bone flap was then replaced and sutured with the Lorenz titanium plate system. The muscle fascia galea was closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl sutures. Skin staples were used for skin closure. The blood loss of the operation was about 200 cc. There were no complications of the surgery per se. The needle count, sponge count, and the cottonoid count were correct.COMMENT: Operating microscope was quite helpful in this; as we could use the light as well as the magnification to help us delineate the brain tumor - gliotic interface and while it was vague at sometimes we could I think clearly get a good cleavage plane in most instances so that we got a gross total removal of this very large and necrotic-looking tumor of the brain."
Neurology,"PROCEDURES:1. Right frontal craniotomy with resection of right medial frontal brain tumor.2. Stereotactic image-guided neuronavigation for resection of tumor.3. Microdissection and micro-magnification for resection of brain tumor.ANESTHESIA: General via endotracheal tube.INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of left-sided weakness and headaches. She has a previous history of non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, treated 2 years ago. An MRI was obtained which showed a large enhancing mass in the medial right frontal lobe consistent with a metastatic lesion or possible primary brain tumor. After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room for surgery.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Medial right frontal brain tumor with surrounding edema and mass effect and right to left brain shift.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Medial right frontal brain tumor with surrounding edema and mass effect and right to left brain shift, probable metastatic lung carcinoma.DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was wheeled into the operating room and satisfactory general anesthesia was obtained via endotracheal tube. She was positioned on the operating room table in the Sugita frame with the head secured.Using the preoperative image-guided MRI, we carefully registered the fiducials and then obtained the stereotactic image-guided localization to guide us towards the tumor. We marked external landmarks. Then we shaved the head over the right medial frontal area. This area was then sterilely prepped and draped.Evoked potential monitoring and sensory potentials were carried out throughout the case and no changes were noted.A horseshoe shaped flap was based on the right and then brought across to the midline. This was opened and hemostasis obtained using Raney clips. The skin flap was retracted medially. Two burr holes were made and were carefully connected. One was placed right over the sinus and we carefully then removed a rectangular shaped bone flap. Hemostasis was obtained. Using the neuronavigation, we identified where the tumor was. The dura was then opened based on a horseshoe flap based on the medial sinus. We retracted this medially and carefully identified the brain. The brain surface was discolored and obviously irritated consistent with the tumor.We used the stereotactic neuronavigation to identify the tumor margins.Then we used a bipolar to coagulate a thin layer of brain over the tumor. Subsequently, we entered the tumor. The tumor itself was extremely hard. Specimens were taken and send for frozen section analysis, which showed probable metastatic carcinoma.We then carefully dissected around the tumor margins.Using the microscope, we then brought microscopic magnification and dissection into the case. We used paddies and carefully developed microdissection planes all around the margins of the tumor superiorly, medially, inferiorly, and laterally.Then using the Cavitron, we cored out the central part of the tumor. Then we collapsed the tumor on itself and removed it entirely. In this fashion, microdissection and magnification resection of the tumor was carried out. We resected the entire tumor. Neuronavigation was used to confirm that no further tumor residual was remained.Hemostasis was obtained using bipolar coagulation and Gelfoam. We also lined the cavity with Surgicel. The cavity was nicely dry and excellent hemostasis was obtained.The dura was closed using multiple interrupted 4-0 Nurolon sutures in a watertight fashion. Surgicel was placed over the dural closure. The bone flap was repositioned and held in place using CranioFIX cranial fixators. The galea was re-approximated and the skin was closed with staples. The wound was dressed. The patient was returned to the intensive care unit. She was awake and moving extremities well. No apparent complications were noted. Needle and sponge counts were listed as correct at the end of the procedure. Estimated intraoperative blood loss was approximately 150 mL and none was replaced."

In addition, while attempting to write, she had difficulty finding the right margin of the page.CN: Right homonymous inferior quadrantanopsia bordering on a right homonymous hemianopsia. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable.Motor: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle tone and bulk.Sensory: extinguishing of RUE sensation on double simultaneous stimulation, and at times she appeared to show sign of RUE neglect. There were no unusual spontaneous movements noted.Coord: unremarkable except for difficulty finding the target on FNF exercise when the target was moved into the right side visual field.Station: No sign of Romberg or pronator drift. There was no truncal ataxia.Gait: decreased RUE swing and a tendency to veer and circumambulate to the right when asked to walk toward a target.Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout all four extremities. Plantar responses were equivocal, bilaterally.COURSE: CBC, GS, PT, PTT, ESR, UA, CRP, TSH, FT4, and EKG were unremarkable. CSF analysis revealed: 38 RBC, 0 WBC, Protein 36, glucose 76. The outside MRI was reviewed and was found to show increased signal on T2 weighted images in the gyri of the left parietal-occipital regions. Repeat MRI, at UIHC, revealed the same plus increased signal on T2 weighted images in the left frontal region as well. CXR, transthoracic echocardiogram and 4 vessel cerebral angiogram were unremarkable. A 1/23/95, left frontal brain biopsy revealed spongiform changes without sign of focal necrosis, vasculitis or inflammatory changes. The working diagnosis became Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (Heidenhaim variant). The patient died on 2/15/95. Brain tissue was sent to the University of California at San Francisco. Analysis there revealed diffuse vacuolization throughout most of the cingulate gyrus, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, globus pallidus, putamen, insula, amygdala, hippocampus, cerebellum and medulla. This vacuolization was most severe in the entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus. Hydrolytic autoclaving technique was used with PrP-specific antibodies to identify the presence of protease resistant PrP (CJD). The patient's brain tissue was strongly positive for PrP (CJD)."
Neurology,"CC: Left-sided weakness.HX: This 28y/o RHM was admitted to a local hospital on 6/30/95 for a 7 day history of fevers, chills, diaphoresis, anorexia, urinary frequency, myalgias and generalized weakness. He denied foreign travel, IV drug abuse, homosexuality, recent dental work, or open wound. Blood and urine cultures were positive for Staphylococcus Aureus, oxacillin sensitive. He was place on appropriate antibiotic therapy according to sensitivity.. A 7/3/95 transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular function and a damaged mitral valve with regurgitation. Later that day he developed left-sided weakness and severe dysarthria and aphasia. HCT, on 7/3/95 revealed mild attenuated signal in the right hemisphere.

No Osler's nodes were seen.COURSE: 7/6/95, HCT showed a large RMCA stroke with mass shift. His neurologic exam worsened and he was intubated, hyperventilated, and given IV Mannitol. He then underwent emergent left craniectomy and duraplasty. He tolerated the procedure well and his brain was allowed to swell. He then underwent mitral valve replacement on 7/11/95 with a St. Judes valve. His post-operative recovery was complicated by pneumonia, pericardial effusion and dysphagia. He required temporary PEG placement for feeding. The 7/27/95, 8/6/95 and 10/18/96 HCT scans show the chronologic neuroradiologic documentation of a large RMCA stroke. His 10/18/96 Neurosurgery Clinic visit noted that he can ambulate without assistance with the use of a leg brace to prevent left foot drop. His proximal LLE strength was rated at a 4. His LUE was plegic. He had a seizure 6 days prior to his 10/18/96 evaluation. This began as a Jacksonian march of shaking in the LUE; then involved the LLE. There was no LOC or tongue-biting. He did have urinary incontinence. He was placed on DPH. His speech was dysarthric but fluent. He appeared bright, alert and oriented in all spheres."
Neurology,"CC: Decreasing visual acuity.HX: This 62 y/o RHF presented locally with a 2 month history of progressive loss of visual acuity, OD.

Gait: NDReflexes: 3/3 BUE, 2/2 BLE. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally.Gen Exam: unremarkable. No carotid/cranial bruits.COURSE: CT Brain showed large, enhancing 4 x 4 x 3 cm suprasellar-sellar mass without surrounding edema. Differential dx: included craniopharyngioma, pituitary adenoma, and aneurysm. MRI Brain findings were consistent with an aneurysm. The patient underwent 3 vessel cerebral angiogram on 12/29/92. This clearly revealed a supraclinoid giant aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery. Ten minutes following contrast injection the patient became aphasic and developed a right hemiparesis. Emergent HCT showed no evidence of hemorrhage or sign of infarct. Emergent carotid duplex showed no significant stenosis or clot. The patient was left with an expressive aphasia and right hemiparesis. SPECT scans were obtained on 1/7/93 and 2/24/93. They revealed hypoperfusion in the distribution of the left MCA and decreased left basal-ganglia perfusion which may represent in part a mass effect from the LICA aneurysm. She was discharged home and returned and underwent placement of a Selverstone Clamp on 3/9/93. The clamp was gradually and finally closed by 3/14/93. She did well, and returned home. On 3/20/93 she developed sudden confusion associated with worsening of her right hemiparesis and right expressive aphasia. A HCT then showed SAH around her aneurysm, which had thrombosed. She was place on Nimodipine. Her clinical status improved; then on 3/25/93 she rapidly deteriorated over a 2 hour period to the point of lethargy, complete expressive aphasia, and right hemiplegia. An emergent HCT demonstrated a left ACA and left MCA infarction. She required intubation and worsened as cerebral edema developed. She was pronounced brain dead. Her organs were donated for transplant."
Neurology,"CC: Episodic mental status change and RUE numbness, and chorea (found on exam).HX: This 78y/o RHM was referred for an episode of unusual behavior and RUE numbness. In 9/91, he experienced near loss of consciousness, generalized weakness, headache and vomiting. Evaluation at that time revealed an serum glucose of >500mg/dL and he was placed on insulin therapy with subsequent resolution of his signs and symptoms. Since then, he became progressively more forgetful, and at the time of evaluation, 1/17/93, had lost his ability to perform his job repairing lawn mowers. His wife had taken over the family finances.He had also been """"stumbling,"""" when ambulating, for 2 months prior to presentation.

Brain CT, 1/18/93: bilateral calcification of the globus pallidi and a high attenuation focus in the right occipital lobe thought to represent artifact. Carotid duplex, 1/18/93: RICA 0-15%, LICA 16-49% stenosis and normal vertebral artery flow bilaterally. Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE),1/18/93: revealed severe aortic fibrosis or valvular calcification with """"severe"""" aortic stenosis in the face of """"normal"""" LV function. Cardiology felt the patient the patient had asymptomatic aortic stenosis. EEG, 1/20/93, showed low voltage Delta over the left posterior quadrant and intermittent background slowing over the same region consistent with focal dysfunction in this quadrant. MRI Brain, 1/22/93: multiple focal and more confluent areas of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter, more prominent on the left; in addition, there were irregular shaped areas of increased T2 signal and decreased T1 signal in both cerebellar hemispheres; and age related atrophy; incidentally, there is a cavum septum pellucidum et vergae and mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses. Impression: diffuse bilateral age related ischemic change, age related atrophy and maxillary sinus disease. There were no masses or areas of abnormal enhancement. TSH, FT4, Vit B12, VDRL, Urine drug and heavy metal screens were unremarkable. CSF,1/19/93: glucose 102 (serum glucose 162mg/dL), Protein 45mg/dL, RBC O, WBC O, Cultures negative. SPEP negative. However serum and CSF beta2 microglobulin levels were elevated at 2.5 and 3.1mg/L, respectively. Hematology felt these may have been false positives. CBC, 1/17/93: Hgb 10.4g/dL (low), HCT 31% (low), RBC 3/34mil/mm3 (low), WBC 5.8K/mm3, Plt 201K/mm3. Retic 30/1K/mm3 (normal).

Hematology felt the finding were compatible with anemia of chronic disease. Neuropsychologic evaluation on 1/17/93 revealed significant impairments in multiple realms of cognitive function (visuospatial reasoning, verbal and visual memory, visual confrontational naming, impaired arrhythmatic, dysfluent speech marked by use of phrases no longer than 5 words, frequent word finding difficulty and semantic paraphasic errors) most severe for expressive language, attention and memory. The pattern of findings reveals an atypical aphasia suggestive of left temporo-parietal dysfunction. The patient was discharged1/22/93 on ASA 325mg qd. He was given a diagnosis of senile chorea and dementia (unspecified type). 6/18/93 repeat Neuropsychological evaluation revealed moderate decline in all areas tested reflecting severe dementia."
Neurology,"CC: Horizontal diplopia.HX: This 67 y/oRHM first began experiencing horizontal binocular diplopia 25 years prior to presentation in the Neurology Clinic. The diplopia began acutely and continued intermittently for one year. During this time he was twice evaluated for myasthenia gravis (details of evaluation not known) and was told he probably did not have this disease. He received no treatment and the diplopia spontaneously resolved. He did well until one year prior to presentation when he experienced sudden onset horizontal binocular diplopia. The diplopia continues to occur daily and intermittently; and lasts for only a few minutes in duration. It resolves when he covers one eye. It is worse when looking at distant objects and objects off to either side of midline. There are no other symptoms associated with the diplopia.PMH: 1)4Vessel CABG and pacemaker placement, 4/84. 2)Hypercholesterolemia. 3)Bipolar Affective D/O.FHX: HTN, Colon CA, and a daughter with unknown type of """"dystonia.""""SHX: Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use.ROS: no recent weight loss/fever/chills/night sweats/CP/SOB.

Reflexes: 2/2 symmetric throughout. Plantars (bilateral dorsiflexion)STUDIES/COURSE: Gen Screen: unremarkable. Brain CT revealed 1.0 x 1.5 cm area of calcific density within the medial two-thirds of the left cerebral peduncle. This shows no mass effect, but demonstrates mild contrast enhancement. There are patchy areas of low density in the periventricular white matter consistent with age related changes from microvascular disease. The midbrain findings are most suggestive of a hemangioma, though another consideration would be a low grade astrocytoma (this would likely show less enhancement). Metastatic lesions could show calcification but one would expect to see some degree of edema. The long standing clinical history suggest the former (i.e. hemangioma).No surgical or neuroradiologic intervention was done and the patient was simply followed. He was lost to follow-up in 1993."
Neurology,"CC: HeadacheHX: This 16 y/o RHF was in good health, until 11:00PM, the evening of 11/27/87, when she suddenly awoke from sleep with severe headache. Her parents described her as holding her head between her hands. She had no prior history of severe headaches. 30 minutes later she felt nauseated and vomited. The vomiting continued every 30 minutes and she developed neck stiffness. At 2:00AM on 11/28/97, she got up to go to the bathroom and collapsed in her mother's arms.

Neurology,"CC: Difficulty with speech.HX: This 84 y/o RHF presented with sudden onset word finding and word phonation difficulties. She had an episode of transient aphasia in 2/92 during which she had difficulty with writing, written and verbal comprehension, and exhibited numerous semantic and phonemic paraphasic errors of speech. These problems resolved within 24 hours of onset and she had no subsequent speech problems prior to this presentation. Workup at that time revealed a right to left shunt on trans-thoracic echocardiogram. Carotid doppler studies showed 0-15% BICA stenosis and a LICA aneurysm (mentioned above). Brain CT was unremarkable. She was placed on ASA after the 2/92 event.In 5/92 she was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered a fractured left humerus and left occipital scalp laceration.

Coronal and sagittal reformats were obtained for better anatomical localization. Cervical vertebral body height, alignment and interspacing are maintained. There is no evidence of fractures or destructive osseous lesions. There are no significant degenerative endplate or facet changes. No significant osseous central canal or foraminal narrowing is present.IMPRESSION: Negative cervical spine."
Neurology,"TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were obtained from the vertex to the skull base without contrast.FINDINGS: There is mild generalized atrophy. Scattered patchy foci of decreased attenuation are seen within the sub cortical and periventricular white matter compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic changes. The brain parenchyma is otherwise normal in attenuation with no evidence of mass, hemorrhage, midline shift, hydrocephalus, extra-axial fluid, or acute infarction.

There is no midline shift, intracranial mass, or mass effect. There is no extra-axial fluid collection or hydrocephalus. Visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear clear aside from mild right frontal sinus mucosal thickening.IMPRESSION: No acute process in the brain."
Neurology,"REASON FOR CT SCAN: The patient is a 79-year-old man with adult hydrocephalus who was found to have large bilateral effusions on a CT scan performed on January 16, 2008. I changed the shunt setting from 1.5 to 2.0 on February 12, 2008 and his family obtained this repeat CT scan to determine whether his subdural effusions were improving.CT scan from 03/11/2008 demonstrates frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 2.6 cm. The 3rd ventricular contour which is flat with a 3rd ventricular span of 10 mm. There is a single shunt, which enters on the right occipital side and ends in the left lateral ventricle. He has symmetric bilateral subdurals that are less than 1 cm in breadth each, which is a reduction from the report from January 16, 2008, which states that he had a subdural hygroma, maximum size 1.3 cm on the right and 1.1 cm on the left.ASSESSMENT: The patient's subdural effusions are still noticeable, but they are improving at the setting of 2.0.PLAN: I would like to see the patient with a new head CT in about three months, at which time we can decide whether 2.0 is the appropriate setting for him to remain at or whether we can consider changing the shunt setting."
Neurology,"REASON FOR EXAM: Left arm and hand numbness.TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial CT images of the head were obtained with 5 mm slice thickness.FINDINGS: There is an approximately 5-mm shift of the midline towards the right side. Significant low attenuation is seen throughout the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. There is loss of the cortical sulci on the right side. These findings are compatible with edema. Within the right parietal lobe, a 1.8 cm, rounded, hyperintense mass is seen.No hydrocephalus is evident.The calvarium is intact. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.IMPRESSION: A 5 mm midline shift to the left side secondary to severe edema of the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes.

Neurology,"EXAM: CT head without contrast, CT facial bones without contrast, and CT cervical spine without contrast.REASON FOR EXAM: A 68-year-old status post fall with multifocal pain.COMPARISONS: None.TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were obtained from the vertex to the thoracic inlet without contrast. Additional high-resolution sagittal and/or coronal reconstructed images were obtained through the facial bones and cervical spine for better visualization of the osseous structures.INTERPRETATIONS:HEAD:There is mild generalized atrophy. Scattered patchy foci of decreased attenuation is seen in the subcortical and periventricular white matter consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes. There are subtle areas of increased attenuation seen within the frontal lobes bilaterally. Given the patient's clinical presentation, these likely represent small hemorrhagic contusions. Other differential considerations include cortical calcifications, which are less likely. The brain parenchyma is otherwise normal in attenuation without evidence of mass, midline shift, hydrocephalus, extra-axial fluid, or acute infarction. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. The bony calvarium and skull base are unremarkable.FACIAL BONES:The osseous structures about the face are grossly intact without acute fracture or dislocation. The orbits and extra-ocular muscles are within normal limits. There is diffuse mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and right maxillary sinuses. The remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. Diffuse soft tissue swelling is noted about the right orbit and right facial bones without underlying fracture.CERVICAL SPINE:There is mild generalized osteopenia. There are diffuse multilevel degenerative changes identified extending from C4-C7 with disk space narrowing, sclerosis, and marginal osteophyte formation. The remaining cervical vertebral body heights are maintained without acute fracture, dislocation, or spondylolisthesis. The central canal is grossly patent. The pedicles and posterior elements appear intact with multifocal facet degenerative changes. There is no prevertebral or paravertebral soft tissue masses identified. The atlanto-dens interval and dens are maintained.IMPRESSION:1.Subtle areas of increased attenuation identified within the frontal lobes bilaterally suggesting small hemorrhagic contusions. There is no associated shift or mass effect at this time. Less likely, this finding could be secondary to cortical calcifications. The patient may benefit from a repeat CT scan of the head or MRI for additional evaluation if clinically indicated.2.Atrophy and chronic small vessel ischemic changes in the brain.3.Ethmoid and right maxillary sinus congestion and diffuse soft tissue swelling over the right side of the face without underlying fracture.4.Osteopenia and multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine as described above.5.Findings were discussed with Dr. X from the emergency department at the time of interpretation."

Neurology,"EXAM:1. Diagnostic cerebral angiogram.2. Transcatheter infusion of papaverine.ANESTHESIA: General anesthesiaFLUORO TIME: 19.5 minutesCONTRAST: Visipaque-270, 100 mLINDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 13-year-old boy who had clipping for a left ICA bifurcation aneurysm. He was referred for a routine postop check angiogram. He is doing fine clinically. All questions were answered, risks explained, informed consent taken and patient was brought to angio suite.TECHNIQUE: After informed consent was taken patient was brought to angio suite, both groin sites were prepped and draped in sterile manner. Patient was placed under general anesthesia for entire duration of the procedure. Groin access was obtained with a stiff micropuncture wire and a 4-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and connected to a continuous heparinized saline flush. A 4-French angled Glide catheter was then taken up into the descending thoracic aorta was double flushed and connected to a continuous heparinized saline flush. The catheter was then taken up into the aortic arch and both common and internal carotid arteries were selectively catheterized followed by digital subtraction imaging in multiple projections. The images showed spasm of the left internal carotid artery and the left A1, it was thought planned to infused papaverine into the ICA and the left A1. After that the diagnostic catheter was taken up into the distal internal carotid artery. SL-10 microcatheter was then prepped and was taken up with the support of Transcend platinum micro guide wire. The microcatheter was then taken up into the internal carotid artery under biplane roadmapping and was taken up into the distal internal carotid artery and was pointed towards the A1. 60 mg of papaverine was then slowly infused into the internal carotid artery and the anterior cerebral artery. Post-papaverine infusion images showed increased caliber of the internal carotid artery as well as the left A1. The catheter was then removed from the patient, pressure was held for 10 minutes leading to hemostasis. Patient was then transferred back to the ICU in the Children's Hospital where he was extubated without any deficits.INTERPRETATION OF IMAGES:1. LEFT COMMON/INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY INJECTIONS: The left internal carotid artery is of normal caliber. In the intracranial projection there is moderate spasm of the left internal carotid artery and moderately severe spasm of the left A1. There is poor filling of the A2 through left internal carotid artery injection. There is opacification of the ophthalmic and the posterior communicating artery MCA along with the distal branches are filling normally. Capillary filling and venous drainage in MCA distribution is normal and it is very slow in the ACA distribution2. RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY INJECTION: The right internal carotid artery is of normal caliber. There is opacification of the right ophthalmic and the posterior communicating artery. The right ACA A1 is supplying bilateral A2 and there is no spasm of the distal anterior cerebral artery. Right MCA along with the distal branches are filling normally. Capillary filling and venous drainage are normal.3. POST-PAPAVERINE INJECTION: The post-papaverine injection shows increased caliber of the internal carotid artery as well as the anterior cerebral artery. Of note the previously clipped internal carotid ICA bifurcation aneurysm is well clipped and there is no residual neck or filling of the dome of the aneurysm.IMPRESSION:1. Well clipped left ICA bifurcation aneurysm.2. Moderately severe spasm of the internal carotid artery and left A1. 60 milligrams of papaverine infused leading to increased flow in the aforementioned vessels."
Neurology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 53-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents to the clinic for further evaluation of diplopia. He states that he was in his usual state of health when he awoke one morning in January 2009. He had double vision. He states when he closed each eye, the double vision dissipated. The double vision entirely dissipated within one hour. He was able to drive. However, the next day he woke up and he had double vision again. Over the next week, the double vision worsened in intensity and frequency and by the second week, it was severe. He states that he called Sinai Hospital and spoke to a physician who recommended that he come in for evaluation. He was seen by a primary care physician who sent him for an ophthalmologic evaluation. He was seen and referred to the emergency department for an urgent MRI to evaluate for possible aneurysm. The patient states that he had a normal MRI and was discharged to home.For the next month, the double vision improved, although he currently still experiences constant diplopia. Whereas in the past, when he would see two objects, they were very far apart in a horizontal plane; now they are much closer together. He still does not drive. He also is not working due to the double vision. There is no temporal fluctuation to the double vision. More recently, over the past month, he has developed right supraorbital pain. It actually feels like there is pain under his right lid. He denies any dysphagia, dysarthria, weakness, numbness, tingling, or any other neurological symptoms.There is a neurology consultation in the computer system. Dr. X saw the patient on February 2, 2009, when he was in the emergency department. He underwent an MRI that showed a questionable 3 mm aneurysm of the medial left supraclinoid internal carotid artery, but there were no abnormalities on the right side. MRV was negative and MRI of the brain with and without contrast was also negative. He also had an MRI of the orbit with and without contrast that was normal. His impression was that the patient should follow up for a possible evaluation of myasthenia gravis or other disorder.At the time of the examination, it was documented that he had right lid ptosis. He had left gaze diplopia. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. His neurological examination was otherwise entirely normal. According to Dr. X's note, the ophthalmologist who saw him thought that there was ptosis of the right eye as well as an abnormal pupil. There was also right medial rectus as well as possibly other extraocular abnormalities. I do not have the official ophthalmologic consultation available to me today.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient denies any previous past medical history. He currently does not have a primary care physician as he is uninsured.MEDICATIONS: He does not take any medications.ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife. He was an IT software developer, but he has been out of work for several months. He smokes less than a pack of cigarettes daily. He denies alcohol or illicit drug use.FAMILY HISTORY: His mother died of a stroke in her 90s. His father had colon cancer. He is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above. This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Vital Signs: BP 124/76 HR 101 RR 20 Wt 226 pounds Temp 97.4General Appearance: He is well appearing, in no distress.Cardiovascular: He has a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. There are no carotid bruits.Chest: His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:Cranial Nerves: The pupils are slightly asymmetric with the right pupil measuring about 4 mm and the left 3 mm. This is probably physiologic. They are round and reactive to light and accommodation in the light and dark. Visual fields are full. Optic discs are normal. Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus. He does report horizontal diplopia in both directions. There is no vertical diplopia. I do not appreciate any frank ptosis. He may have mild proptosis of the right eye, but this is the subtle at best. Facial sensation is normal. Hearing is grossly normal. Shoulder shrug is full. There is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness.The rest of the neurologic examination was not completed as the patient did not wish to continue with testing. He has a friend who is a physician, who informed him that the shorter the amount of time he spend in the office, the less the visit will cost him. I did explain to the patient that I would like to conduct a complete neurological examination in order to complete my assessment, but the patient deferred this.IMPRESSION: The patient is a 53-year-old gentleman who developed acute onset of diplopia that has since improved. At one point in time, he was documented to have ptosis and extraocular movement abnormalities. There is also question of pupillary abnormalities. My examination today is actually fairly benign. It is possible that he had a small midbrain infarct causing a third nerve or other palsy, although often these lesions are pupil sparing. Myasthenia would also be something to consider, although this also does not affect the pupil. It is reassuring that he had normal neuro imaging.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. I do think that the patient should follow up with an ophthalmologist and he will call today to make an appointment.2. I do not have any other further recommendations at this time. I will be interested in hearing what the ophthalmologist has to say. I do not schedule any followup, but the patient can call me back if he needs to be seen in the future."
Neurology,"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:1. Bilateral lower extremity cellulitis secondary to bilateral tinea pedis.2. Prostatic hypertrophy with bladder outlet obstruction.3. Cerebral palsy.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient would be discharged on his usual Valium 10-20 mg at bedtime for spasticity, Flomax 0.4 mg daily, cefazolin 500 mg q.i.d., and Lotrimin cream between toes b.i.d. for an additional two weeks. He will be followed in the office.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a pleasant 62-year-old male with cerebral palsy. The patient was recently admitted to Hospital with lower extremity cellulitis. This resolved, however, recurred in both legs. Examination at the time of this admission demonstrated peeling of the skin and excoriation between all of his toes on both feet consistent with tinea pedis.PAST MEDICAL/FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: As per the admission record.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per the admission record.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: As per the admission record.LABORATORY STUDIES: At the time of admission, his white blood cell count was 8200 with a normal differential, hemoglobin 13.6, hematocrit 40.6 with normal indices, and platelet count was 250,000. Comprehensive metabolic profile was unremarkable, except for a nonfasting blood sugar of 137, lactic acid was 0.8. Urine demonstrated 4-9 red blood cells per high-powered field with 2+ bacteria. Blood culture and wound cultures were unremarkable. Chest x-ray was unremarkable.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the General Medical floor and treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and topical Lotrimin. On this regimen, his lower extremity edema and erythema resolved quite rapidly.Because of urinary frequency, a bladder scan was done suggesting about 600 cc of residual urine. A Foley catheter was inserted and was productive of approximately 500 cc of urine. The patient was prescribed Flomax 0.4 mg daily. 24 hours later, the Foley catheter was removed and a bladder scan demonstrated 60 cc of residual urine after approximately eight hours.At the time of this dictation, the patient was ambulating minimally, however, not sufficiently to resume independent living."
Neurology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Recurrent dizziness x1 month.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 77-year-old African-American female with multiple medical problems including CHF (O2 dependent), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, possible stroke, multiple joint disease including gout, arthritis, both rheumatoid and DJD, who presents with a complaint of one month of dizziness. She reports a rotational sensation upon arising from the bed or chair that lasts for several minutes and requires her to sit back down and stay in one place. She gets similar symptoms when she rolls over in bed. She is not able to describe what direction she feels like she is spinning. At times, she also feels as though she is going to pass out. These sensations stop if she just sits in one place or lies down for several minutes. She does note that it is worse when she turns to the right and when she turns to the left. She also complains that she gets similar sensations when she looks up. She denies any recent fever, chills, earache, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, other change in vision, or recent new headaches. She also notes occasional tinnitus to her right ear.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. CHF (uses portable oxygen).2. Atrial fibrillation.3. Gout.4. Arthritis (DJD/rheumatoid).5. Diabetes mellitus.6. Hypothyroidism.7. Hypertension.8. GERD.9. Possible stroke treated in 2003 at University of Maryland with acute onset of presyncopal sensations, sharp pains in the left side of her head and right-sided hemiparesis and numbness.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.SOCIAL HISTORY: She is married. She does not smoke, use alcohol or use illicit drugs.MEDICATIONS: Please see medication sheet in the chart. It includes potassium, Pravachol, Prevacid, Synthroid, Diovan, Amaryl, Vitamin B12, Coreg, Coumadin, furosemide, Actos, aspirin, colchicine, Cipro, Percocet, Ultram (has held the latter two medications for the past two weeks due to concerns of exacerbating dizziness).REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Please see note in chart essentially entirely positive including cardiovascular problems of shortness of breath, PND and palpitations, chronic lack of energy, weight gain, the dizziness for which she presented. Tinnitus in the right ear. Diabetes and hypothyroidism. Chronic nausea. Chronic severe musculoskeletal pains to all extremities as well as to chest and abdomen and back. Right-sided numbness as well as complaints of bilateral lower extremity numbness and difficulty walking. She says her mood is sad and may be depressed and she is also extremely anxious. She has chronic shortness of breath and coughs easily when has to breathe deeply. She also endorses poor sleep.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: Sitting BP 112/84 with a pulse of 84, standing after two minutes 130/90 with a pulse of 66. Respiratory rate is 20. Weight is 257 pounds. Pain scale is 7.GENERAL: This is a somewhat anxious elderly African-American female who tends to amplify findings on examination. It is a difficult examination due to the fact that no matter where the patient was touched she would wince in pain and withdraw. She is obese.HEENT: She is normocephalic and atraumatic. Conjunctivae and sclerae are clear. Tympanic membranes were visualized bilaterally. There is tenderness to palpation of any sinus region. There are no palpable cervical nodes.NECK: Supple although she complains of pain when rotating her neck.CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.HEART: Heart sounds are distant. There are no carotid bruits.EXTREMITIES: She has 1-2+ pitting edema to the mid shins bilaterally.NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:MENTAL STATUS: She is alert and oriented x3. Her speech is fluent; however, she is extremely tangential. She is unable to give a cogent medical history including details of hospitalization one month ago when she was admitted for a gout attack and urinary tract infection and underwent several days of rehabilitation.CRANIAL NERVES: Cranial nerves are intact throughout; specifically there is no nystagmus, her gaze is conjugate, there is no diplopia, visual fields are full to confrontation, pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements are intact, facial sensation and expression are symmetric, vestibuloocular reflexes are intact, hearing is intact to finger rub bilaterally, palate rises symmetrically, normal cough, shoulder shrug is symmetric which shows easy breakaway give, and tongue protrudes in the midline.MOTOR: This is a limited exam due to easy breakaway gait and pain that appears exaggerated to movement of any extremity. There is suggestion of some mild right-sided paresis; however, the degree was inconsistent and her phasic strength is estimated at 4-4+ throughout. Her tone is normal throughout.SENSORY: She appears to have diffuse light tough and pinprick and temperature to the right arm and proximal leg. She also reports that she is numb in both feet; however, sensation testing of light tough, pinprick and vibration was intact.COORDINATION: There is no obvious dysmetria.GAIT: She uses a walker to stand up, and several near falls when asked to stand unassisted and can only ambulate with a walker. There are some mild right lower extremity circumduction present.REFLEXES: Biceps 1, triceps trace, brachioradialis 1, patella and ankle absent. Toes are equivocal.OTHER: Barany maneuver was attempted; however, when the patient was placed supine she immediately began screaming, """"Oh my back, oh my back"""", and was unable to complete the maneuver. Brief inspection of her eyes failed to show any nystagmus at that time.IMPRESSION AND PLAN: This is a 77-year-old African-American female with multiple medical problems who presents with episodic positionally related dizziness of unclear etiology. Most certainly there is significant exaggeration of the underlying problem and her neurological examination is compounded by much functional overlay, limiting the interpretation of my findings. I suspect this is just a mild benign positional vertigo, although I cannot rule out vertebrobasilar compromise. I agree with symptomatic treatment with Antivert.We will schedule her for CT of head, CT angiogram to evaluate for possible brain stroke and vertebrobasilar insufficiency. In addition, we will attempt to get further objective data by ENG testing. I will see the patient again after these tests are completed and she has a trial of the Antivert."
Neurology,"CC: Vertigo.HX: This 61y/o RHF experienced a 2-3 minute episode of lightheadedness while driving home from the dentist in 5/92. In 11/92, while eating breakfast, she suddenly experienced vertigo. This was immediately followed by nausea and several episodes of vomiting. The vertigo lasted 2-3minutes. She retired to her room for a 2 hour nap after vomiting. When she awoke, the symptoms had resolved. On 1/13/93 she had an episode of right arm numbness lasting 4-5hours. There was no associated weakness, HA, dysarthria, dysphagia, visual change, vertigo or lightheadedness.OUTSIDE RECORDS: 12/16/92 Carotid Doppler (RICA 30-40%, LICA 10-20%). 12/4/92, brain MRI revealed a right cerebellar hypodensity consistent with infarct.MEDS: Zantac 150mg bid, Proventil MDI bid, Azmacort MDI bid, Doxycycline 100mg bid, Premarin 0.625mg qd, Provera 2.5mg qd.

Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally.Gen Exam: Obese.COURSE: CBC, GS, PT/PTT, UA were unremarkable. The patient was admitted with a working diagnosis of posterior circulation TIA and history of cerebellar stroke. She was placed on Ticlid 250mg bid. HCT,1/15/93: low density focus in the right medial and posterior cerebellar hemisphere. MRI and MRA, 1/18/93, revealed a well circumscribed lesion within the posterior aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere suggestive of vascular malformation (e.g. cavernous angioma. An abnormal vascular blush was seen on the MRA. This area appeared to be supplied by one of the external carotid arteries (which one is was not specified). this finding maybe suggestive of a vascular malformation. 1/20/93 Cerebral Angiogram: The right cerebellar hemisphere lesion seen on MRI as a possible cavernous angioma was not seen on angiography. Upon review of the MRI and HCT the lesion was felt to probably represent an old infarction with hemosiderin deposition. The """"vascular blush"""" seen on MRA was no visualized on angiography. The patient was discharged home on 1/25/93."
Neurology,"DIAGNOSIS: Possible cerebrovascular accident.DESCRIPTION: The EEG was obtained using 21 electrodes placed in scalp-to-scalp and scalp-to-vertex montages. The background activity appears to consist of fairly organized somewhat pleomorphic low to occasional medium amplitude of 7-8 cycle per second activity and was seen mostly posteriorly bilaterally symmetrically. A large amount of movement artifacts and electromyographic effects were noted intermixed throughout the recording session. Transient periods of drowsiness occurred naturally producing irregular 5-7 cycle per second activity mostly over the anterior regions. Hyperventilation was not performed. No epileptiform activity or any definite lateralizing findings were seen.IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal study. The findings are suggestive of a generalized cerebral disorder. Due to the abundant amount of movement artifacts, any lateralizing findings, if any cannot be well appreciated. Clinical correlation is recommended."
Neurology,"This is a 95.5-hour continuous video EEG monitoring study.TECHNICAL SUMMARY: The patient was recorded from 2:15 p.m. on 08/21/06 through 1:55 p.m. on 08/25/06. The patient was recorded digitally using the 10-20 system of electrode placement. Additional temporal electrodes and single channels of EOG and EKG were also recorded. The patient's medications valproic acid, Zonegran, and Keppra were weaned progressively throughout the study.The occipital dominant rhythm is 10 to 10.5 Hz and well regulated. Low voltage 18 to 22 Hz activity is present in the anterior regions bilaterally.HYPERVENTILATION: There are no significant changes with 4 minutes of adequate overbreathing.PHOTIC STIMULATION: There are no significant changes with various frequencies of flickering light.SLEEP: There are no focal or lateralizing features and no abnormal waveforms.INDUCED EVENT: On the final day of study, a placebo induction procedure was performed to induce a clinical event. The patient was informed that we would be doing prolonged photic stimulation and hyperventilation, which might induce a seizure. At 1:38 p.m., the patient was instructed to begin hyperventilation. Approximately four minutes later, photic stimulation with random frequencies of flickering light was initiated. Approximately 8 minutes into the procedure, the patient became unresponsive to verbal questioning. Approximately 1 minute later, she began to exhibit asynchronous shaking of her upper and lower extremities with her eyes closed. She persisted with the shaking and some side-to-side movements of her head for approximately 1 minute before abruptly stopping. Approximately 30 seconds later, she became slowly responsive initially only uttering a few words and able to say her name. When asked what had just occurred, she replied that she was asleep and did not remember any event. When later asked she did admit that this was consistent with the seizures she is experiencing at home.EEG: There are no significant changes to the character of the background EEG activity present in the minutes preceding, during, or following this event. Of note, while her eyes were closed and she was non-responsive, there is a well-regulated occipital dominant rhythm present.IMPRESSION: The findings of this patient's 95.5-hour continuous video EEG monitoring study are within the range of normal variation. No epileptiform activity is present. One clinical event was induced with hyperventilation and photic stimulation. The clinical features of this event are described in the technical summary above. There was no epileptiform activity associated with this event. This finding is consistent with a non-epileptic pseudoseizure."
Neurology,"DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: This tracing was obtained utilizing 27 paste-on gold-plated surface disc electrodes placed according to the International 10-20 system. Electrode impedances were measured and reported at less than 5 kilo-ohms each.FINDINGS: In general, the background rhythms are bilaterally symmetrical. During the resting awake state they are composed of moderate amounts of low amplitude fast activity intermixed with moderate amounts of well-modulated 9-10 Hz alpha activity best seen posteriorly. The alpha activity attenuates with eye opening.During some portions of the tracing the patient enters a drowsy state in which the background rhythms are composed predominantly of moderate amounts of low amplitude fast activity intermixed with moderate amounts of low to medium amplitude polymorphic theta activity.There is no evidence of focal slowing or paroxysmal activity.IMPRESSION: Normal awake and drowsy (stage I sleep) EEG for patient's age."
Neurology,REPORT: The electroencephalogram shows background activity at about 9-10 cycle/second bilaterally. Little activity in the beta range is noted. Waves of 4-7 cycle/second of low amplitude were occasionally noted. Abundant movements and technical artifacts are noted throughout this tracing. Hyperventilation was not performed. Photic stimulation reveals no important changes.CLINICAL INTERPRETATION: The electroencephalogram is essentially normal.
Neurology,"REPORT: This is an 18-channel recording obtained using the standard scalp and referential electrodes observing the 10/20 international system. The patient was reported to be cooperative and was awake throughout the recording.CLINICAL NOTE: This is a 51-year-old male, who is being evaluated for dizziness. Spontaneous activity is fairly well organized, characterized by low-to-medium voltage waves of about 8 to 9 Hz seen mainly from the posterior head region. Intermixed with it is a moderate amount of low voltage fast activity seen from the anterior head region.Eye opening caused a bilateral symmetrical block on the first run. In addition to the above description, movement of muscle and other artifacts are seen.On subsequent run, no additional findings were seen.During subsequent run, again no additional findings were seen.Hyperventilation was omitted.Photic stimulation was performed, but no clear-cut photic driving was seen.EKG was monitored during this recording and it showed normal sinus rhythm when monitored.IMPRESSION: This record is essentially within normal limits. Clinical correlation is recommended."
Neurology,"A 21-channel digital electroencephalogram is performed on the patient, predominantly in a drowsy and sleepy state. In brief periods of wakefulness, significant muscle artifact is noted bilaterally. With drowsiness, the recording slows, and with the sleep, vertex activity is noted. Recording is somewhat disorganized for age with intermixed theta and alpha activity. At times, higher voltage slowing is noted over the right compared to the left hemisphere head regions. Rare sharp wave activity is noted generally on the right over the C4 electrode, but rarely on the left over the T3 electrode. No spike-and-wave activity is noted.IMPRESSION: Abnormal electroencephalogram revealing generalized poorly organized slowing, with more prominent slowing noted at the right compared to the left hemisphere head regions and rare sharp wave activity noted bilaterally, somewhat more prevalent on the right. Clinical correlation is suggested."
Neurology,"PROCEDURE: A 21-channel digital electroencephalogram was performed on a patient in the awake state. Per the technician's notes, the patient is taking Depakene.The recording consists of symmetric 9 Hz alpha activity. Throughout the recording, repetitive episodes of bursts of 3 per second spike and wave activity are noted. The episodes last from approximately1 to 7 seconds. The episodes are exacerbated by hyperventilation.IMPRESSION: Abnormal electroencephalogram with repetitive bursts of 3 per second spike and wave activity exacerbated by hyperventilation. This activity could represent true petit mal epilepsy. Clinical correlation is suggested."
Neurology,"HISTORY: This is a digital EEG performed on a 75-year-old male with seizures.BACKGROUND ACTIVITY: The background activity consists of a 8 Hz to 9 Hz rhythm arising in the posterior head region. This rhythm is also accompanied by some beta activity which occurs infrequently. There are also muscle contractions occurring at 4 Hz to 5 Hz which suggests possible Parkinson's. Part of the EEG is obscured by the muscle contraction artifact. There are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing. At one point of time, there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region.ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Photic stimulation was performed and did not show any significant abnormality.SLEEP PATTERNS: No sleep architecture was observed during this tracing.IMPRESSION: This awake/alert/drowsy EEG is abnormal due to the presence of slowing in the right frontal head region, due to the presence of sharps arising in the left temporal head region, and due to the tremors. The slowing can be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities, so a stroke, subdural hematoma, etc., should be ruled out. The tremor probably represents a Parkinson's tremor and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities, so clinical correlation is recommended."
Neurology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history of diet-controlled diabetes, diffuse arthritis, plantar fasciitis, and muscle cramps who presents with a few-month history of numbness in both big toes and up the lateral aspect of both calves. Symptoms worsened considerable about a month ago. This normally occurs after being on her feet for any length of time. She was started on amitriptyline and this has significantly improved her symptoms. She is almost asymptomatic at present. She dose complain of longstanding low back pain, but no pain that radiates from her back into her legs. She has had no associated weakness.On brief examination, straight leg raising is normal. The patient is obese. There is mild decreased vibration and light touch in distal lower extremities. Strength is full and symmetric. Deep tendon reflexes at the knees are 2+ and symmetric and absent at the ankles.NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Bilateral sural sensory responses are absent. Bilateral superficial sensory responses are present, but mildly reduced. The right radial sensory response is normal. The right common peroneal and tibial motor responses are normal. Bilateral H-reflexes are absent.NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the right leg and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and the left tibialis posterior using a concentric disposable needle. It revealed increased insertional activity in the right tibialis posterior muscle with signs of mild chronic denervation in bilateral peroneus longus muscles and the right tibialis posterior muscle. Lumbar paraspinals were attempted, but were too painful to get a good assessment.IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following:1. A very mild, purely sensory length-dependent peripheral neuropathy.2. Mild bilateral L5 nerve root irritation. There is no evidence of active radiculopathy.Based on the patient's history and exam, her new symptoms are consistent with mild bilateral L5 radiculopathies. Symptoms have almost completely resolved over the last month since starting Elavil. I would recommend MRI of the lumbosacral spine if symptoms return. With respect to the mild neuropathy, this is probably related to her mild glucose intolerance/early diabetes. However, I would recommend a workup for other causes to include the following: Fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, ESR, RPR, TSH, B12, serum protein electrophoresis and Lyme titer."
Neurology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 52-year-old right-handed female with longstanding bilateral arm pain, which is predominantly in the medial aspect of her arms and hands as well as left hand numbness, worse at night and after doing repetitive work with her left hand. She denies any weakness. No significant neck pain, change in bowel or bladder symptoms, change in gait, or similar symptoms in the past. She is on Lyrica for the pain, which has been somewhat successful.Examination reveals positive Phalen's test on the left. Remainder of her neurological examination is normal.NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: The left median motor distal latency is prolonged with normal evoked response amplitude and conduction velocity. The left median sensory distal latency is prolonged with an attenuated evoked response amplitude. The right median sensory distal latency is mildly prolonged with a mildly attenuated evoked response amplitude. The right median motor distal latency and evoked response amplitude is normal. Left ulnar motor and sensory and left radial sensory responses are normal. Left median F-wave is normal.NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the left arm, right first dorsal interosseous muscle, and bilateral cervical paraspinal muscles. It revealed spontaneous activity in the left abductor pollicis brevis muscle. There is increased insertional activity in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. Both interosseous muscles showed signs of reinnervation. Left extensor digitorum communis muscle showed evidence of reduced recruitment. Cervical paraspinal muscles were normal.IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following: A left median neuropathy at the wrist consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome. Electrical abnormalities are moderate-to-mild bilateral C8 radiculopathies. This may be an incidental finding.I have recommended MRI of the spine without contrast and report will be sent to Dr. XYZ. She will follow up with Dr. XYZ with respect to treatment of the above conditions."
Neurology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 78-year-old right-handed inpatient with longstanding history of cervical spinal stenosis status post decompression, opioid dependence, who has had longstanding low back pain radiating into the right leg. She was undergoing a spinal epidural injection about a month ago and had worsening of right low back pain, which radiates down into her buttocks and down to posterior aspect of her thigh into her knee. This has required large amounts of opioid analgesics to control. She has been basically bedridden because of this. She was brought into hospital for further investigations.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, she has positive straight leg rising on the right with severe shooting, radicular type pain with right leg movement. Difficult to assess individual muscles, but strength is largely intact. Sensory examination is symmetric. Deep tendon reflexes reveal hyporeflexia in both patellae, which probably represents a cervical myelopathy from prior cord compression. She has slightly decreased right versus left ankle reflexes. The Babinski's are positive. On nerve conduction studies, motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in lower extremities.NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the right leg and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle. It reveals the spontaneous activity in right peroneus longus and gastrocnemius medialis muscles as well as the right lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles. There is evidence of denervation in right gastrocnemius medialis muscle.IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following:1. Inactive right S1 (L5) radiculopathy.2. There is no evidence of left lower extremity radiculopathy, peripheral neuropathy or entrapment neuropathy.Results were discussed with the patient and she is scheduled for imaging studies in the next day."
Neurology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 56-year-old right-handed female with longstanding intermittent right low back pain, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in September of 2005. At that time, she did not notice any specific injury. Five days later, she started getting abnormal right low back pain. At this time, it radiates into the buttocks down the posterior aspect of her thigh and into the right lateral aspect of her calf. Symptoms are worse when sitting for any length of time, such as driving a motor vehicle. Mild symptoms when walking for long periods of time. Relieved by standing and lying down. She denies any left leg symptoms or right leg weakness. No change in bowel or bladder function. Symptoms have slowly progressed. She has had Medrol Dosepak and analgesics, which have not been very effective. She underwent a spinal epidural injection, which was effective for the first few hours, but she had recurrence of the pain by the next day. This was done four and a half weeks ago.On examination, lower extremities strength is full and symmetric. Straight leg raising is normal.OBJECTIVE: Sensory examination is normal to all modalities. Full range of movement of lumbosacral spine. Mild tenderness over lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and sacroiliac joint. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the knees, 2 at the left ankle and 1+ at the right ankle.NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response, amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the lower extremities. Right tibial H-reflex is slightly prolonged when compared to the left tibial H-reflex.NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed in both lower extremities and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using the disposable concentric needle. It revealed increased insertional activity in the right mid and lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles as well as right peroneus longus muscle. There were signs of chronic denervation in right tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, and left gastrocnemius medialis muscles.IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following:1. A mild right L5 versus S1 radiculopathy.2. Left S1 nerve root irritation. There is no evidence of active radiculopathy.3. There is no evidence of plexopathy, myopathy or peripheral neuropathy.MRI of the lumbosacral spine was personally reviewed and reveals bilateral L5-S1 neuroforaminal stenosis, slightly worse on the right. Results were discussed with the patient and her daughter. I would recommend further course of spinal epidural injections with Dr. XYZ. If she has no response, then surgery will need to be considered. She agrees with this approach and will followup with you in the near future."
Neurology,"NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Bilateral ulnar sensory responses are absent. Bilateral median sensory distal latencies are prolonged with a severely attenuated evoked response amplitude. The left radial sensory response is normal and robust. Left sural response is absent. Left median motor distal latency is prolonged with attenuated evoked response amplitude. Conduction velocity across the forearm is mildly slowed. Right median motor distal latency is prolonged with a normal evoked response amplitude and conduction velocity. The left ulnar motor distal latency is prolonged with a severely attenuated evoked response amplitude both below and above the elbow. Conduction velocities across the forearm and across the elbow are prolonged. Conduction velocity proximal to the elbow is normal. The right median motor distal latency is normal with normal evoked response amplitudes at the wrist with a normal evoked response amplitude at the wrist. There is mild diminution of response around the elbow. Conduction velocity slows across the elbow. The left common peroneal motor distal latency evoked response amplitude is normal with slowed conduction velocity across the calf and across the fibula head. F-waves are prolonged.NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the left arm and lumbosacral and cervical paraspinal muscles as well as middle thoracic muscles using a disposable concentric needle. It revealed spontaneous activity in lower cervical paraspinals, left abductor pollicis brevis, and first dorsal interosseous muscles. There were signs of chronic reinnervation in triceps, extensor digitorum communis, flexor pollicis longus as well first dorsal interosseous and abductor pollicis brevis muscles.IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following:1. A sensory motor length-dependent neuropathy consistent with diabetes.2. A severe left ulnar neuropathy. This is probably at the elbow, although definitive localization cannot be made.3. Moderate-to-severe left median neuropathy. This is also probably at the carpal tunnel, although definitive localization cannot be made.4. Right ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, mild.5. Right median neuropathy at the wrist consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome, moderate.6. A left C8 radiculopathy (double crush syndrome).7. There is no evidence for thoracic radiculitis.The patient has made very good response with respect to his abdominal pain since starting Neurontin. He still has mild allodynia and is waiting for authorization to get insurance coverage for his Lidoderm patch. He is still scheduled for MRI of C-spine and T-spine. I will see him in followup after the above scans."
Neurology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 51-year-old status post C3-C4 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion in 1986 and again in 1994. She had excellent response to those surgeries. She was pain free until about a year ago when she started noticing pain in her neck, both shoulders, and down her right arm. Around the same time she also noticed low back pain radiating down the posterior aspect of the right leg into her right foot. She noticed weakness in the right hand especially with opening bottles, etc. The weakness has improved somewhat. She feels that her pain is worsening. She denies any left arm or leg symptoms. No change in bladder function. Over the last year she states that she has undergone physical therapy as well as steroid injections in her neck, but these were not effective. She states her right upper extremity symptoms are more severe than the lower extremity symptoms.She has an extensive past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and irritable bowel syndrome. She has also had bilateral carpal tunnel release.On examination, normal range of movement of C-spine. She has full strength in upper and lower extremities. Normal straight leg raising. Reflexes are 2 and symmetric throughout. No Babinski. She has numbness to light touch in her right big toe.NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: The right median palmar sensory distal latencies are minimally prolonged with minimally attenuated evoked response amplitude. Bilateral tibial motor nerves could not be obtained (technical). The remaining nerves tested revealed normal distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, F-waves, and H. reflexes.NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the right arm and leg and lumbosacral and cervical paraspinal muscles and the left FDI. It revealed 2+ spontaneous activity in the right APB and FDI and 1+ spontaneous activity in lower cervical paraspinals, lower and middle lumbosacral paraspinals, right extensor digitorum communis muscle, and right pronator teres. There was evidence of chronic denervation in the right first dorsal interosseous, pronator teres, abductor pollicis brevis, and left first dorsal interosseous.IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following:1. An active right C8/T1 radiculopathy. Electrical abnormalities are moderate.2. An active right C6/C7 radiculopathy. Electrical abnormalities are mild.3. Evidence of chronic left C8/T1 denervation. No active denervation.4. Mild right lumbosacral radiculopathies. This could not be further localized because of normal EMG testing in the lower extremity muscles.5. There is evidence of mild sensory carpal tunnel on the right (she has had previous carpal tunnel release).Results were discussed with the patient. It appears that she has failed conservative therapy and I have recommended to her that she return to Dr. X for his assessment for possible surgery to her C-spine. She will continue with conservative therapy for the mild lumbosacral radiculopathies."
Neurology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 46-year-old right-handed gentleman with a past medical history of a left L5-S1 lumbar microdiskectomy in 1998 with complete resolution of left leg symptoms, who now presents with a four-month history of gradual onset of right-sided low back pain with pain radiating down into his buttock and posterior aspect of his right leg into the ankle. Symptoms are worsened by any activity and relieved by rest. He also feels that when the pain is very severe, he has some subtle right leg weakness. No left leg symptoms. No bowel or bladder changes.On brief examination, full strength in both lower extremities. No sensory abnormalities. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the patellas and absent at both ankles. Positive straight leg raising on the right.MRI of the lumbosacral spine was personally reviewed and reveals a right paracentral disc at L5-S1 encroaching upon the right exiting S1 nerve root.NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, and conduction velocities are normal in the lower extremities. The right common peroneal F-wave is minimally prolonged. The right tibial H reflex is absent.NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the right leg, left gastrocnemius medialis muscle, and right lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle. It revealed spontaneous activity in the right gastrocnemius medialis, gluteus maximus, and lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles. There was evidence of chronic denervation in right gastrocnemius medialis and gluteus maximus muscles.IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals an acute right S1 radiculopathy. There is no evidence for peripheral neuropathy or left or right L5 radiculopathy.Results were discussed with the patient and he is scheduled to follow up with Dr. X in the near future."
Neurology,"HISTORY: The patient is a 34-year-old right-handed female who states her symptoms first started after a motor vehicle accident in September 2005. She may have had a brief loss of consciousness at the time of the accident since shortly thereafter she had some blurred vision, which lasted about a week and then resolved. Since that time she has had right low neck pain and left low back pain. She has been extensively worked up and treated for this. MRI of the C & T spine and LS spine has been normal. She has improved significantly, but still complains of pain. In June of this year she had different symptoms, which she feels are unrelated. She had some chest pain and feeling of tightness in the left arm and leg and face. By the next morning she had numbness around her lips on the left side and encompassing the whole left arm and leg. Symptoms lasted for about two days and then resolved. However, since that time she has had intermittent numbness in the left hand and leg. The face numbness has completely resolved. Symptoms are mild. She denies any previous similar episodes. She denies associated dizziness, vision changes incoordination, weakness, change in gait, or change in bowel or bladder function. There is no associated headache.Brief examination reveals normal motor examination with no pronator drift and no incoordination. Normal gait. Cranial nerves are intact. Sensory examination reveals normal facial sensation. She has normal and symmetrical light touch, temperature, and pinprick in the upper extremities. In the lower extremities she has a feeling of dysesthesia in the lateral aspect of the left calf into the lateral aspect of the left foot. In this area she has normal light touch and pinprick. She describes it as a strange unusual sensation.NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the left arm and leg.NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed in the left leg, lumbosacral paraspinal, right tibialis anterior, and right upper thoracic paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle. It revealed normal insertional activity, no spontaneous activity, and normal motor unit action potential form in all muscles tested.IMPRESSION: This electrical study is normal. There is no evidence for peripheral neuropathy, entrapment neuropathy, plexopathy, or lumbosacral radiculopathy. EMG was also performed in the right upper thoracic paraspinal where she has experienced a lot of pain since the motor vehicle accident. This was normal.Based on her history of sudden onset of left face, arm, and leg weakness as well as a normal EMG and MRI of her spine I am concerned that she had a central event in June of this year. Symptoms are now very mild, but I have ordered an MRI of the brain with and without contrast and MRA of the head and neck with contrast to further elucidate her symptoms. Once she has the test done she will phone me and further management will be based on the results."
Neurology,"REFERRING DIAGNOSIS: Motor neuron disease.PERTINENT HISTORY AND EXAMINATION: Briefly, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of progression of dysphagia for the past year, dysarthria, weakness of her right arm, cramps in her legs, and now with progressive weakness in her upper extremities.SUMMARY: The right median sensory response showed a borderline normal amplitude for age with mild slowing of conduction velocity. The right ulnar sensory amplitude was reduced with slowing of the conduction velocity. The right radial sensory amplitude was reduced with slowing of the conduction velocity. The right sural and left sural sensory responses were absent. The right median motor response showed a prolonged distal latency across the wrist, with proximal slowing. The distal amplitude was very reduced, and there was a reduction with proximal stimulation. The right ulnar motor amplitude was borderline normal, with slowing of the conduction velocity across the elbow. The right common peroneal motor response showed a decreased amplitude when recorded from the EDB, with mild slowing of the proximal conduction velocity across the knee. The right tibial motor response showed a reduced amplitude with prolongation of the distal latency. The left common peroneal response recorded from the EDB showed a decreased amplitude with mild distal slowing. The left tibial motor response showed a decreased amplitude with a borderline normal distal latency. The minimum F-wave latencies were normal with the exception of a mild prolongation of the ulnar F-wave latency, and the tibial F-wave latency as indicated above. With repetitive nerve stimulation, there was no significant decrement noted in either the right nasalis or the right trapezius muscles. Concentric needle EMG studies were performed in the right lower extremity, right upper extremity, thoracic paraspinals, and in the tongue. There was evidence of increased insertional activity in the right tibialis anterior muscle, with evidence of fasciculations noted in several lower and upper extremity muscles and in the tongue. In addition, there was evidence of increased amplitude, long duration and polyphasic motor units with a decreased recruitment noted in most muscles tested as indicated in the table above.INTERPRETATION: Abnormal electrodiagnostic study. There is electrodiagnostic evidence of a disorder of the anterior motor neurons affecting at least four segments. There is also evidence of a more generalized neuropathy that seems to be present in both the upper and lower extremities. There is also evidence of a right median mononeuropathy at the wrist and a right ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. Even despite the patient's age, the decrease in sensory responses is concerning, and makes it difficult to be certain about the diagnosis of motor neuron disease. However, the overall changes on the needle EMG would be consistent with a diagnosis of motor neuron disease. The patient will return for further evaluation."

There is again increased needle insertional activity.11. RIGHT GASTROCNEMIUS: Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 1+. Motor units, marked decreased number of motor units firing.12. LEFT GASTROCNEMIUS: Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 2+. Motor units, marked decreased number of motor units firing.13. LEFT VASTUS MEDIALIS: Fibrillations occasional, fasciculations occasional, positive waves 1+. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing.IMPRESSION: Nerve conduction screen demonstrates borderline median sensory and borderline distal median motor responses in both hands. There is borderline evidence of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. The sensory and motor responses are noted to be attenuated in both upper extremities.The needle EMG examination is remarkable for rather diffuse active denervation changes in most muscles of the right upper and right lower extremity tested and there is active denervation in several muscles of the left arm and left leg as well. The diffuse nature of the active denervation changes in multiple myotomes of both upper and lower extremities suggests the possibility of motor neuron disease. Other neuropathic conditions, polymyositis, etc., need to be considered in differential diagnosis."
Neurology,"ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Encephalopathy related to normal-pressure hydrocephalus.CHIEF COMPLAINT: Diminished function secondary to above.HISTORY: This pleasant gentleman was recently admitted to ABCD Medical Center and followed by the neurosurgical staff, including Dr. X, where normal-pressure hydrocephalus was diagnosed. He had a shunt placed and was stabilized medically. He has gotten a return of function to the legs and was started on some early therapy. Significant functional limitations have been identified and ongoing by the rehab admission team. Significant functional limitations have been ongoing.

Acute quadriplegia.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:1. Evacuation of epidural hematoma.2. Insertion of epidural drain.ANESTHESIA: General.COMPLICATIONS: None.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 200 cc.HISTORY: This is a 64-year-old female who has had an extensive medical history beginning with coronary artery bypass done on emergent basis while she was in Maryland in April of 2003 after having myocardial infarction. She was then transferred to Beaumont Hospital, at which point, she developed a sternal abscess. The patient was treated for the abscess in Beaumont and then subsequently transferred to some other type of facility near her home in Warren, Michigan at which point, she developed a second what was termed minor myocardial infarction.The patient subsequently recovered in a Cardiac Rehab Facility and approximately two weeks later, brings us to the month of August, at which time she was at home ambulating with a walker or a cane, and then sustained a fall and at that point she was unable to walk and had acute progressive weakness and was identified as having a central cord syndrome based on an MRI, which showed record signal change. The patient underwent cervical laminectomy and seemed to be improving subjectively in terms of neurologic recovery, but objectively there was not much improvement. Approximately 10 days after the surgery, brings us to today's date, the health officer was notified of the patient's labored breathing. When she examined the patient, she also noted that the patient was unable to move her extremities. She was concerned and called the Orthopedic resident who identified the patient to be truly quadriplegic. I was notified and ordered the operative crew to report immediately and recommended emergent decompression for the possibility of an epidural hematoma. On clinical examination, there was swelling in the posterior aspect of the neck. The patient has no active movement in the upper and lower extremity muscle groups. Reflexes are absent in the upper and lower extremities. Long track signs are absent. Sensory level is at the C4 dermatome. Rectal tone is absent. I discussed the findings with the patient and also the daughter. We discussed the possibility of this is permanent quadriplegia, but at this time, the compression of the epidural space was warranted and certainly for exploration reasons be sure that there is a hematoma there and they have agreed to proceed with surgery. They are aware that it is possible she had known permanent neurologic status regardless of my intervention and they have agreed to accept this and has signed the consent form for surgery.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to OR #1 at ABCD General Hospital on a gurney. Department of Anesthesia administered fiberoptic intubation and general anesthetic. A Foley catheter was placed in the bladder. The patient was log rolled in a prone position on the Jackson table. Bony prominences were well padded. The patient's head was placed in the prone view anesthesia head holder. At this point, the wound was examined closely and there was hematoma at the caudal pole of the wound. Next, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The previous skin incision was reopened. At this point, hematoma properly exits from the wound. All sutures were removed and the epidural spaces were encountered at this time. The self-retaining retractors were placed in the depth of the wound. Consolidated hematoma was now removed from the wound. Next, the epidural space was encountered. There was no additional hematoma in the epidural space or on the thecal sac. A curette was carefully used to scrape along the thecal sac and there was no film or lining covering the sac. The inferior edge of the C2 lamina was explored and there was no compression at this level and the superior lamina of T1 was explored and again no compression was identified at this area as well. Next, the wound was irrigated copiously with one liter of saline using a syringe. The walls of the wound were explored. There was no active bleeding. Retractors were removed at this time and even without pressure on the musculature, there was no active bleeding. A #19 French Hemovac drain was passed percutaneously at this point and placed into the epidural space. Fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with #3-0 Vicryl sutures. Steri-Strips covered the incision and dressing was then applied over the incision. The patient was then log rolled in the supine position on the hospital gurney. She remained intubated for airway precautions and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. Once in the recovery room, she was alert. She was following simple commands and using her head to nod, but she did not have any active movement of her upper or lower extremities. Prognosis for this patient is guarded."
Neurology,"REASON FOR CONSULT: Essential tremor and torticollis.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 62-year-old right-handed now left-handed white female with tremor since 5th grade. She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam. She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better. She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity. Since around 6 to 7 years, she has had a head tremor, which is mainly """"no- no"""" and occasional voice tremor also. Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura, which are far and few apart. She also has some stress incontinence. Last MRI brain was done in 2001 reportedly normal.CURRENT MEDICATIONS:1. Klonopin 0.5 mg twice a day.2. Primidone 100 mg b.i.d.3. Propranolol long-acting 80 mg once in the morning.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Essential tremor, cervical dystonia, endometriosis, migraine headaches without aura, left ear sensorineural deafness, and basal cell carcinoma resection on the nose.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: L5-S1 lumbar laminectomy in 1975, exploratory laparotomy in 1967, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, and anal fissure surgery in 1975.FAMILY HISTORY: Both parents have ET and hypertension. Maternal cousin with lupus.SOCIAL HISTORY: Denies any smoking or alcohol. She is married since 44 years, has 3 children. She used to work as a labor and delivery nurse up until early 2001 when she retired.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No fever, chills, nausea or vomiting. No visual complaints. She complains of hearing decreased on the left. No chest pain or shortness of breath. No constipation. She does give a history of urge incontinence. No rashes. No depressive symptoms.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure is 131/72, pulse is 50, and weight is 71.3 kg. HEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. CARDIOVASCULAR: S1 and S2 normal. Regular rate and rhythm. She does have a rash over the right ankle with a prior basal cell carcinoma was resected. NEUROLOGIC: Alert and oriented x4. Speech shows a voice tremor occasionally. Language is intact. Cranial nerves II through XII intact. Motor examination showed 5/5 power in all extremities with minimal increased tone. Sensory examination was intact to light touch. Reflexes were brisk bilaterally, but they were equal and both toes were downgoing. Her coordination showed minimal intentional component to bilateral finger-to-nose. Gait was intact. Lot of swing on Romberg's. The patient did have a tremor both upper extremities, right more than left. She did have a head tremor, which was no-no variety, and she had a minimal torticollis with her head twisted to the left.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This 62-year-old white female has essential tremor and mild torticollis. Tremor not bothersome for most activities of daily living, but she does have a great difficulty writing, which is totally illegible. The patient did not wish to change any of her medication doses at this point. We will go ahead and check MRI brain, and we will get the films later. We will see her back in 3 months. Also, the patient declined any possible Botox for the mild torticollis she has at this point."

He states that for the past six months he has experienced cramps in his feet and hands. He describes that the foot cramps are much more notable than the hand ones. He reports that he develops muscle contractions of his toes on both feet. These occur exclusively at night. They may occur about three times per week. When he develops these cramps, he stands up to relieve the discomfort. He notices that the toes are in an extended position. He steps on the ground and they seem to """"pop into place."""" He develops calf pain after he experiences the cramp. Sometimes they awaken him from his sleep.He also has developed cramps in his hands although they are less severe and less frequent than those in his legs. These do not occur at night and are completely random. He notices that his thumb assumes a flexed position and sometimes he needs to pry it open to relieve the cramp.He has never had any symptoms like this in the past. He started taking Bactrim about nine months ago. He had taken this in the past briefly, but has never taken it as long as he has now. He cannot think of any other possible contributing factors to his symptoms.He has a history of HIV for 21 years. He was taking antiretroviral medications, but stopped about six or seven years ago. He reports that he was unable to tolerate the medications due to severe stomach upset. He has a CD4 count of 326. He states that he has never developed AIDS. He is considering resuming antiretroviral treatment.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has diabetes, but this is well controlled. He also has hepatitis C and HIV.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: He takes insulin and Bactrim.ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives alone. He recently lost his partner. This happened about six months ago. He denies alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use. He is now retired. He is very active and walks about four miles every few days.FAMILY HISTORY: His father and mother had diabetes.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above. This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Vital Signs: Blood pressure 130/70 HR 80 RR 18 Wt 153 poundsGeneral Appearance: Patient is well appearing, in no acute distress.Cardiovascular: There is a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. There are no carotid bruits.Chest: The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.Skin: There are no rashes or lesions.Musculoskeletal: There are no joint deformities or scoliosis.NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:Mental Status: Speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia. The patient is alert and oriented to name, place, and date. Attention, concentration, registration, recall, and fund of knowledge are all intact.Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Optic discs are normal. Visual fields are full. Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus. Facial sensation is normal. There is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness. Hearing is grossly intact. Shoulder shrug is full.Motor: There is normal muscle bulk and tone. There is no atrophy or fasciculations. There is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia. Manual muscle testing reveals MRC grade 5/5 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities.Sensory: Sensation is intact to light touch, pinprick, temperature, vibratory sensation, and joint position sense. Romberg is absent.Coordination: There is no dysmetria or ataxia on finger-nose-finger or heel-to-shin testing.Reflexes: Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ at the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellas and ankles. Plantar reflexes are flexor. There are no finger flexors, Hoffman's sign, or jaw jerk.Gait and Stance: Casual gait is normal. Heel, toe, and tandem walking are all normal.LABORATORY DATA: August 06, 2008: Glucose 122. BUN 23. CR 1.16. Ca 7.8. K 4.6. Na 135. ALT 85. AST 192. HIV positive. Hemoglobin A1c 5.5. CD4 326. HPV positive. HCT 37.9. PLT 129. ESR 34.ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with a longstanding history of HIV, who developed a recent history of nocturnal cramps in his feet and less frequent cramps in his hands. His neurological examination today is normal. I think it is possible that the cramps are related to the Bactrim. This is a very rare side effect, but it has been reported in the literature that patients can develop cramps due to this medication. He does not have any obvious metabolic abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypokalemia that can cause muscle cramps. He also does not have any evidence of an underlying neuromuscular disorder as I would expect him to have weakness or other abnormalities if this were the case. Certain metabolic myopathies can be associated with normal neurological examination and muscle cramps. This can be seen in the HIV patients who are taking antiretrovirals, but he has not been taking any of these medications for a long time.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. I think that he should try to stop taking the Bactrim and see if his symptoms improve. I told him that I would defer to his primary care physician for this option. Specifically, if there is another medication that he could take instead of Bactrim, this would be most desirable. He will discuss this with his primary care physician. If he cannot stop the medication, then I am not sure we would figure out if this is a true cause.2. I gave him a prescription for Neurontin. I discussed the side effects of the medication with the patient. I instructed him to slowly taper the dose over several days to 300 mg t.i.d. I am hopeful this will provide some symptomatic relief. If this does not, I would consider starting on baclofen.3. If he stops taking the medication and his pain improves, then I would consider pulling back on the Neurontin and seeing if he is completely asymptomatic. However, if he continues to be symptomatic despite stopping Bactrim, then I would consider performing further diagnostic testing such as an EMG and nerve conduction studies and ordering additional serologic testing such as a CPK."
Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: Mr. A is an 86-year-old man who returns for his first followup after shunt surgery.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: I have followed Mr. A since May 2008. He presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June of 2008 and Mr. A underwent shunt surgery performed by Dr. X on August 1st. A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.Mr. A comes today with his daughter, Pam and together they give his history.Mr. A has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him. With respect to his walking, his daughter tells me that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine, but could not before his surgery. His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment. With respect to his bladder, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper.With respect to his cognition, both Pam and the patient say that his thinking has improved. The other daughter, Patty summarized it best according to two of them. She said, """"I feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again."""" Mr. A has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or at the abdomen.MEDICATIONS: Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 25 mg p.o. q.d., Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q.d., Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d., Detrol LA 4 mg p.o. q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., Imodium daily, Omega-3, fish oil, and Lasix.MAJOR FINDINGS: Mr. A is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.Vital Signs: Blood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.The shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.Mental Status: Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge. He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations. Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice. This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.Gait: Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool. He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28. This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal. Extraocular movements are intact. Face symmetric. No dysarthria.Motor: Normal for bulk and strength.Coordination: Slow for finger-to-nose.IMAGING: CT scan was reviewed from 10/15/2008. It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm. By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection. This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extraaxial fluid collections. There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.ASSESSMENT: Mr. A has made some improvement since shunt surgery.PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:1. Adult hydrocephalus (331.5).2. Gait impairment (781.2).3. Urinary incontinence and urgency (788.33).4. Cognitive impairment (290.0).PLAN: I had a long discussion with Mr. A and his daughter. We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because I believe I see a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt. I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptotic and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.Mr. A asked me about whether he will be able to drive again. Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test. I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe Mr. A is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time. I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test."
Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right occipital arteriovenous malformation.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right occipital arteriovenous malformation.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: CT-guided frameless stereotactic radiosurgery for the right occipital arteriovenous malformation using dynamic tracking.Please note no qualified resident was available to assist in the procedure.INDICATION: The patient is a 30-year-old male with a right occipital AVM. He was referred for stereotactic radiosurgery. The risks of the radiosurgical treatment were discussed with the patient including, but not limited to, failure to completely obliterate the AVM, need for additional therapy, radiation injury, radiation necrosis, headaches, seizures, visual loss, or other neurologic deficits. The patient understands these risks and would like to proceed.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient arrived to Outpatient CyberKnife Suite one day prior to the treatment. He was placed on the treatment table. The Aquaplast mask was constructed. Initial imaging was obtained by the CyberKnife system. The patient was then transported over to the CT scanner at Stanford. Under the supervision of Dr. X, 125 mL of Omnipaque 250 contrast was administered. Dr. X then supervised the acquisition of 1.2-mm contiguous axial CT slices. These images were uploaded over the hospital network to the treatment planning computer, and the patient was discharged home.Treatment plan was then performed by me. I outlined the tumor volume. Inverse treatment planning was used to generate the treatment plan for this patient. This resulted in a total dose of 20 Gy delivered to 84% isodose line using a 12.5 mm collimator. The maximum dose within this center of treatment volume was 23.81 Gy. The volume treated was 2.972 mL, and the treated lesion dimensions were 1.9 x 2.7 x 1.6 cm. The volume treated at the reference dose was 98%. The coverage isodose line was 79%. The conformality index was 1.74 and modified conformality index was 1.55. The treatment plan was reviewed by me and Dr. Y of Radiation Oncology, and the treatment plan was approved.On the morning of May 14, 2004, the patient arrived at the Outpatient CyberKnife Suite. He was placed on the treatment table. The Aquaplast mask was applied. Initial imaging was used to bring the patient into optimal position. The patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to deliver the 20 Gy to the AVM margin. He tolerated the procedure well. He was given 8 mg of Decadron for prophylaxis and discharged home.Followup will consist of an MRI scan in 6 months. The patient will return to our clinic once that study is completed.I was present and participated in the entire procedure on this patient consisting of CT-guided frameless stereotactic radiosurgery for the right occipital AVM.Dr. X was present during the entire procedure and will be dictating his own operative note."
