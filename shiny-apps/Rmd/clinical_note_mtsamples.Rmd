The clinical notes at [mtsamples.com](https://www.mtsamples.com/) are provided by users and has been verified by various experts???ref to be close to the real clinical notes. We scraped all notes using R `rvest` package ([code](https://github.com/GL-Li/clinical_notes/blob/master/web_scrabing_mtsample_com.R)). 

The 4999 sample clinical notes at this website has been categorized into 40 sample types / medical specialties. Most of the categories are distinct medical specialties (specialty for short) dealing with unique organ systems, such as cardiovascular / pulmonary,  gastroenterology and urology. Some of them cover more broad range including consult - history and phy., radiology, surgery, and discharge summary. 

As we mentioned, the headers of sections variies from notes to notes. From the 4999 clinical notes, we found 1910 unique headers. Most of them are rare, only appearing in a few of clinical notes: 230 in one notes, 773 in two notes, 200 in three notes, and 84% of them in less than ten notes. 

Using the as-is section headers, there is no single section header appears in the majority of clinical notes. The most popular section "ANESTHESIA" appears in 27% of notes. The lack of dominance, however, does not suggest that the content of clinical notes lack a consistent theme???. It is more likely because of how the sectins are named. For example, the combined sections " PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS" and "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES" score 35%, and obviously they are the same. Actually there are 72 unique section headers containing "DIAGNOSIS" or "DIAGNOSES". Even worse, 154 unique section headers contain "HISTORY". A lot of work is needed to clean this mess up.
