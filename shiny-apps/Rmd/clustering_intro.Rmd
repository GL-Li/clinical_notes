We use three methods to cluster the clinical notes: principle component analysis, hierarchical clustering, and K-means clustering. The corpora used are the original clinical notes and medical named entities extracted with Amazon Comprehend Medical. We will only include three medical specialties: gastroenterology, neurology, and urology for better visualization.
