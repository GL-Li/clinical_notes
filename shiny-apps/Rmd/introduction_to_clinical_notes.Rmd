It compiles???? data from various sources, including your own description of your symptoms, your answers to the nurse's or doctor's questions, doctor's diagnosis, physical exams, lab reports, radiology report, and discharge summaries. A typical note may cover the reasons for the hospitalization, significant findings, procedures, treatments, patient conditions at discharge, and patient and caregiver instructions.

Clinical notes contains rich information that can be mined for potential [applications](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jhe/2018/4302425/#B34) in medical decision support, disease risk prediction,  mobile health, network medical treatment, personalized healthcare, disease evolution prediction and drug reaction detection. There have been researches try to predict [readmission risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10663), [clinical intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08498), [early psychiatric readmission ](https://www.nature.com/articles/tp2015182.pdf), [Adverse Drug Events](Predicting Adverse Drug Events), and [chronic diseases](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04928) using clinical notes. Clinical note can also be used to [link social, behavioral, and cultural factors to health and disease outcomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25717417) and  [derive??? medical code](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1100/).

As unstructured free-form text, clinical notes poses?? particular challenges to text analytics. Ideally, a clinical note is divided into multiple sections to account for the diverse soruces; common sections include chief complaint, history of present illness, diaganosis, precedures, medications, and discharge disposition etc. In reality, however, healthcare providers structure the clinical note in their own ways and often use various section titles for the same contents. Knowing the section a word belongs to is imperative???too-strong?? to understand the meaning of the word. For example, a drug name in section medication means the patient was taking the drug, while in section allegy indicates the patient did not take the drug.

Another obstacle is the restricted access to clincal notes, as the use of protected heath information (PHI) is regulated by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States. Public datasets such as [MIMIC-III](https://mimic.physionet.org/) and [i2b2 / n2c2](https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/) are subject to application and approval. Although the collection of data can be used in text analytics, individual notes are not allowed to be displayed to the public????. 

To get around the restrictions, we will use clinical notes scraped from [mtsamples.com](https://www.mtsamples.com/). This website has a collection of 4999 sample clinical notes and these samples are "free to print, share, link, and distribute".
