<h3>svm</h3>

<p>The total number of samples in gas-neu-uro is only 599 while the matrix has 1644 columns. Apply svm directly on this matrix produces very poor result, even cannot train, as the R e1071 package <code>svm()</code> function is uable to handle constant columns. In the case of tfidf, some columns only have a few non-zero rows. After train-test splitting, the train set has chances to have columns with all values 0. To get around this problem, we use PCA and keep the top principle components. </p>

<h3>Metrics of each algorithm</h3>

<p>Data split: 70% in train and 30% in test. 
The train data is further split to 70% (or 2/3) for training and 30% (or 1/3) for validation to tune hyperparameters. The final model is built with these parameters. </p>

<p>The test data is used in prediction. The metric is calculated from y_test and y_pred.</p>

<p>Repeat above process 100 time to calculate mean and standard deviation of each metrics, as shown in the table below.</p>

<p>For svm, we keep first 25 principle components, as it performs best that keeping fewer or more principle components.</p>
